# SkyyRose v2 Mockup — Visual Direction Lock

**Date:** 2026-05-25
**Status:** Approved through Q3-synthesis
**Mode:** Standalone design ref (no WP integration, no deploy)
**Owner:** Claude (DevSkyy engineering agent)
**Deliverable file:** `docs/brand/design-mockups/v2.html`

## Mission

Lock the visual direction for SkyyRose's next-generation homepage + Black Rose collection page before any production translation. Produce one self-contained HTML file that demonstrates the **magazine-as-site** thesis with real brand assets, the locked collection fonts, and scroll-driven motion. Sign-off here becomes the contract for the production phase that follows.

## Reference Set (Locked)

Pull every visual move from these five brands. Do not reach for the European-luxury-house lineage (Bottega / Numéro / Hedi Slimane / Rick Owens / 032c / Givenchy by Tisci) — that set is locked out at `docs/brand/visual-references.md` and `feedback_brand_visual_references.md` in memory.

| Reference | What we pull |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Kith** | Monogram-led editorial photography, magazine masthead, retail-store-integrated lookbook |
| **Oaklandish** | "For The Town" civic-pride messaging, local landmark photography |
| **Culture Kings** | Drop-density on the spread frame, sneaker/sport patch hero treatment |
| **Fear of God** | Cinematic sepia photography palette, oversized type on hero, sport DNA |
| **Palm Angels** | Sport heritage motifs, embroidery macros, vintage athletic colorism |

## The Thesis

**The site is a magazine. Scroll = page turn.**

Each scroll-snap landing is a magazine page that serves a distinct role. Four roles in vertical sequence. Production-side this means each "frame" becomes its own section with scroll-driven entrance choreography, but in v2.html they read as one continuous editorial composition.

## Composition — Homepage (Surface 1 of 2)

### Frame 01 — Cover

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Masthead | "SKYY ROSE" in Cinzel 700 / 84px desktop, 48px mobile, letter-spacing 0.05em. Thin 1px rule underneath. |
| Meta block (right) | Space Mono 9px / 0.3em letter-spacing. Three lines: "VOL. IV", "S/S 2026", "THE TOWN · DROP 01". |
| Cover photo | `assets/branding/hero/forbidden-midnight-{480,768,1280,1680}w.webp` — `<picture>` with `srcset` for responsive. Fullbleed behind masthead. Dark overlay gradient top + bottom. |
| Monogram graffiti | Playfair italic 700 / 96px / `#B76E79` / rotated -7deg / overlaid on photo, positioned right-third. |
| Cover line | Bebas Neue 56px desktop / 32px mobile, color split: "Luxury Grows from" white, "Concrete." rose-gold. |
| By-line | Inter 10px / 0.3em letter-spacing / "By Corey Foster · Oakland · 2026" |
| Barcode | SVG inline. Below it: Space Mono 9px "03 · 26 · DROP 01". |

### Frame 02 — Hero (Town Cinema)

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Background | `assets/branding/hero/luxury-nighttime-*.webp` — Oakland industrial scene, fullbleed. Same `<picture>` responsive pattern. |
| Kicker | Space Mono 9px / 0.4em / "For The Town" / top-left. |
| Headline | Bebas Neue 48px / "BLACK ROSE I SPRING DROP" / "I" in rose-gold to act as visual separator. |
| Bottom bar | Two-column Space Mono: left "Photographed in East Oakland", right "14 looks · 4 collections · One town" — separated by 1px top border. |
| Scroll behavior | Parallax: background scrolls at 0.6x, text scrolls at 1x. |

### Frame 03 — Voice

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Background | Pure `#0a0a0a` with two radial gradients (rose-gold from bottom, gold from top) at low opacity. No photo. |
| Quote | Playfair Display italic 56px (desktop) / 36px (mobile), three lines: "Named after" / "a daughter." (rose-gold) / "Built by a father." |
| Attribution | Space Mono 10px / 0.5em letter-spacing / "Corey Foster · The Town" / centered under 1px top border. |
| Motion | Three-line stagger reveal on scroll-into-view, 0.15s delay between lines. Quote stays fixed for ~80vh of scroll before releasing. |

### Frame 04 — Spread

| Element | Spec |
|---------|------|
| Section title | Bebas Neue 22px / "THE COLLECTIONS" / gold. |
| Sub | Space Mono 9px / "PG 04—05 · BLACK ROSE · LOVE HURTS · SIGNATURE · KIDS" |
| Layout | 4-tile grid (1.4fr / 1fr / 1fr / 1fr). One large feature tile + three supporting. |
| Tile content | Each tile = collection thumbnail using `assets/branding/{black-rose,love-hurts,signature}-logo-hero.webp` + brand colors. |
| Motion | Tiles enter with staggered scroll-driven reveal. Hover = subtle scale 1.02 + rose-gold border glow. |

## Composition — Black Rose Page (Surface 2 of 2)

Same magazine engine, BR-specific dressing. Continuation of the homepage thesis — no register departure. This is what "one engine, four worlds" means in the new lineage.

| Element | Black Rose treatment |
|---------|----------------------|
| Cover masthead | "BLACK ROSE" Cinzel 84px replaces "SKYY ROSE" at the top. Subtitle: "A SKYY ROSE COLLECTION". |
| Cover photo | `assets/branding/black-rose-logo-hero.webp` or `black-rose-monogram-sr.jpg` if hero-fit. |
| Cover line | "Built for those who move through darkness like it's home." (from brand-DNA skill product copy spec). |
| Hero | Sepia palette darkened. Sport patch macro inset (NFL/NBA/MLB/Hockey patches as small product-detail squares). |
| Voice frame | **"You wear it / because you / already stood up."** — Black Rose story tagline, verbatim founder-locked from `docs/brand/collection-stories.md` (line: Story Tagline). 3-line stack matches the homepage voice-frame pattern. Playfair italic. Middle line in rose-gold. Attribution: "Black Rose · The Town · 2026". |
| Spread | 6-8 Black Rose SKUs only. Loaded from `data/skyyrose-catalog.csv` filtered by collection=black-rose. Pulled via static reference in this mockup (not a CSV runtime read). |
| Palette tweak | Silver `#C0C0C0` replaces gold accent in this view. Rose-gold and crimson stay. |

## Typography System

All loaded via Google Fonts `@import` in v2.html (no theme integration). When this spec translates to production, fonts come from `assets/fonts/` self-hosted woff2.

| Role | Font | Where |
|------|------|-------|
| Magazine masthead | Cinzel 700 | F01 nameplate |
| Hero headline | Bebas Neue | F02 headline, F04 section title |
| Voice quote | Playfair Display italic 400 + 700 | F03 quote |
| Cover line | Bebas Neue + Playfair italic accent | F01 |
| Meta / kickers / attribution | Space Mono 400 | F01 meta block, F02 kicker, F03 attribution, F04 sub |
| Body / nav | Inter 300/400/600 | by-lines, nav, captions |
| Brand-mark accent | Playfair Display italic 700 | "SR" graffiti on F01 |

Collection-specific accents (held in reserve for collection pages):
- Italiana — Signature display
- Yellowtail — Love Hurts script accent
- Pinyon Script — Signature script accent
- UnifrakturMaguntia — Black Rose gothic accent (sparingly, only for special drops)

## Motion Budget

Standalone mockup, so motion runs in-browser with vanilla JS + CSS. No Three.js for v2 — that decision was overturned by the brand-DNA reset.

| Effect | Implementation |
|--------|----------------|
| Frame entrance reveal | IntersectionObserver toggling `.is-visible` class with CSS transition |
| Parallax (F02 background) | `requestAnimationFrame` + `getBoundingClientRect()` → `translateY(scrollY * 0.6px)` |
| Voice quote stagger | CSS `transition-delay` on `.is-visible` per-child |
| Spread tile stagger | Same pattern as voice, with per-tile delay |
| Hover micro-interactions | CSS-only `transform` + `box-shadow` transitions |
| Reduced-motion fallback | `@media (prefers-reduced-motion: reduce)` forces all `.is-visible` states immediately, suppresses parallax |

No WebGL. No canvas. The "visualize the impossible" requirement is met by **typography + scroll choreography + photographic composition**, not by 3D scenes.

## Assets Used

Verified to exist in `wordpress-theme/skyyrose-flagship/assets/branding/`:

| Asset | Used in |
|-------|---------|
| `hero/forbidden-midnight-{480,768,1280,1680}w.webp` | F01 cover photo (homepage) |
| `hero/luxury-nighttime-{480,768,1280,1680}w.webp` | F02 hero photo (homepage) |
| `hero/beauty-and-beast-{480,768,1280,1680}w.webp` | F02 hero photo alternate (Black Rose page) |
| `skyyrose-monogram-nav.webp` (742B) | nav-bound monogram in mockup nav bar |
| `black-rose-logo-hero.webp` (50.0K) | Black Rose page cover photo |
| `black-rose-monogram-sr.jpg` | Black Rose page accent |
| `love-hurts-logo-hero.webp` | F04 spread tile (Love Hurts) |
| `signature-logo-hero.webp` | F04 spread tile (Signature) |

Assets get inlined via relative path from `docs/brand/design-mockups/v2.html` → `../../../wordpress-theme/skyyrose-flagship/assets/branding/...`. Browser will resolve.

## File Structure

```
docs/brand/design-mockups/
├── v2.html                  ← the deliverable
├── v2-assets/               ← only if any inline imagery is custom-made for the mockup
└── README.md                ← short pointer to this spec
```

v2.html is one file. CSS embedded in `<style>` (no external stylesheet). JS embedded in `<script>` (no module imports). Fonts via Google Fonts `@import`.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. v2.html renders all 4 frames for both surfaces (homepage + Black Rose) in a single scrollable document.
2. Real brand assets load from `../../../wordpress-theme/skyyrose-flagship/assets/branding/`.
3. All 9+ fonts in the system render correctly (visual check).
4. IntersectionObserver-driven reveals run smoothly at 60fps on M-series laptops.
5. `prefers-reduced-motion: reduce` correctly suppresses all motion + forces all reveals to visible.
6. Mobile breakpoint (≤768px) holds composition (headlines downsize per spec, tile grid collapses).
7. No external CDN dependencies beyond Google Fonts. No npm. No build step.
8. Lighthouse accessibility score ≥95 (alt text, semantic landmarks, contrast — checked locally).

## Out of Scope (do not do in this artifact)

- WordPress theme integration
- WooCommerce product card rendering
- Real cart/checkout flow
- Production CSS architecture (`design-tokens.css`, `landing-pages.css`, etc.)
- Three.js or WebGL of any kind
- Collection pages beyond Black Rose (Love Hurts / Signature / Kids saved for future)
- Per-collection PDP variants

### Canon reservations for future collection pages

When Love Hurts gets its own v2-style page (future phase, separate spec):

- Voice frame line: **"Hurts is the bloodline that raised me."** — founder-locked 2026-05-23. "Hurts" is Corey Foster's family name. This line belongs ONLY to Love Hurts. Do not place it on Black Rose, Signature, or Kids.
- Palette: Crimson `#DC143C` accent on deep black background.
- Display font: Yellowtail script accent + Playfair italic primary.
- Source: `docs/brand/collection-stories.md` → Love Hurts section.

Reservation noted to prevent the same misattribution loop on the next pass.

## Implementation Mode

Single Write call producing one HTML file (estimated 800-1500 lines depending on CSS depth). After v2.html ships:

1. User opens `docs/brand/design-mockups/v2.html` in browser.
2. Validate visually against this spec.
3. If approved → translate to production templates as a separate phase (becomes its own spec + plan + execute cycle).
4. If refine needed → I iterate v2.html in place until approved.

## Risk

| Risk | Mitigation |
|------|------------|
| Real brand assets at relative path fail to resolve | Test load once in browser before declaring v2.html complete. |
| Google Fonts CDN fails offline | All 9 fonts are also available self-hosted at `assets/fonts/` — fallback path documented as a comment in v2.html. |
| Mockup oversells what production can ship | Spec explicitly notes "no Three.js" + "vanilla JS only" so production translation is realistic. |
| 60fps degraded on older mobile | Parallax disabled at ≤480px; reduced-motion respected. |
