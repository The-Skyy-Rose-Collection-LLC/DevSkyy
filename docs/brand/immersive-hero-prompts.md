# Immersive Hub — Dedicated Hero Master Prompts (Midjourney) · v2

**Purpose:** one dedicated cinematic hero master per collection for the `/experiences/` full-bleed blocks (placement `experience-hero`). v2 (2026-06-17) = imagery-team concepts (4 photography-directors) + Brand Guardian pass. Replaces v1's ornate-ballroom interim look.

## The 4 scene concepts
| Collection | Concept | One line |
|---|---|---|
| Signature | **4 AM on the Ledge** | The night the brand was born — Oakland rooftop, gold rose on concrete, Bay Bridge burning in the haze. |
| Black Rose | **Concrete Refusal** | A black rose forced through a crack in a West Oakland I-880 pillar — silver-rimmed, rain-wet, refusing the dark. |
| Love Hurts | **The Beast at the Threshold** | A rain-slick Oakland alley — the Beast's gate ajar, only the snapped crimson rose left burning. |
| Kids Capsule | **The City Is the Throne** | A child, back to camera, faces the Oakland skyline at dusk — the city built for them is the inheritance. |

## Generation spec (every prompt)
- `--ar 16:9 --v 7 --style raw` · master 2560×1440; export WebP+AVIF + the srcset ladder (640·1024·1536·2048·2560w) into `assets/branding/hero/`.
- **Composition law (these are BACKGROUNDS for a centered lockup):** center third = calm negative space, focal subject in lower/side thirds, edges fall to a dark vignette so the overlaid lockup reads.
- **Brand register (LOCKED):** Kith / Oaklandish / Culture Kings / Fear of God / Palm Angels. Oakland/Bay concrete luxury. NEVER European luxury-house / baroque ballroom / fairytale castle. **No blue/navy anywhere** (founder ban).

## After generation — drop-in procedure
1. Save each master to `wordpress-theme/skyyrose-flagship/assets/branding/hero/<slug>-hero-2560w.webp` (+ avif) and the ladder `-640/-1024/-1536/-2048/-2560w`.
2. Set `imagery.hero` in each `data/collections/<slug>/identity.json` to `branding/hero/<slug>-hero`.
3. Re-run the SOT build + `verify-collection-sot.py` (the min-2560 gate passes once masters exist).
4. The `experience-hero` placement auto-engages the srcset; re-render the hub. Each block now its own canon scene; the gold Signature lockup pops on the darker master.
