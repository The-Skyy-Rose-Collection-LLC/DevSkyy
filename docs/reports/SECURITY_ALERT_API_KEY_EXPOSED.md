# 🚨 SECURITY ALERT - API KEY EXPOSED

**Date:** December 16, 2025
**Severity:** CRITICAL
**Status:** IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED

---

## ⚠️ CRITICAL SECURITY ISSUE

An OpenAI API key was exposed in the conversation history. This key has been compromised and must be revoked immediately.

**Exposed Key Pattern:** `sk-proj-mxV316lWmUh5x6fW...`

---

## 🔴 IMMEDIATE ACTIONS REQUIRED

### 1. Revoke the Exposed API Key (DO THIS NOW)

1. Go to: <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>
2. Log in to your OpenAI account
3. Find the key starting with `sk-proj-mxV316lWmUh5x6fW...`
4. Click "Revoke" or "Delete" immediately
5. Confirm the revocation

### 2. Generate a New API Key

1. On the same page: <https://platform.openai.com/api-keys>
2. Click "Create new secret key"
3. Give it a descriptive name (e.g., "DevSkyy Production - Dec 2025")
4. Copy the new key immediately (you won't see it again)
5. Store it securely

### 3. Update Your Environment Variables

**Option A: Add to shell profile (recommended)**

```bash
# Add to ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
echo 'export OPENAI_API_KEY="your-new-key-here"' >> ~/.zshrc
source ~/.zshrc
```

**Option B: Add to .env file**

```bash
# Create or edit .env file
echo 'OPENAI_API_KEY=your-new-key-here' >> .env
```

**IMPORTANT:** Make sure `.env` is in `.gitignore`!

### 4. Verify .gitignore Protection

```bash
# Check if .env is protected
grep -q "^\.env$" .gitignore && echo "✓ Protected" || echo "✗ NOT PROTECTED - ADD NOW"

# If not protected, add it:
echo ".env" >> .gitignore
```

### 5. Check for Accidental Commits

```bash
# Search git history for API keys
git log -p | grep -i "sk-proj-" || echo "No keys found in git history"

# If found, you need to rewrite git history (dangerous - get help)
```

## 🛡️ SECURITY BEST PRACTICES

### Never Expose API Keys

❌ **DON'T:**

- Share API keys in chat/messages
- Commit API keys to git
- Include API keys in code
- Post API keys in screenshots
- Store API keys in plain text files (unless .gitignored)

✅ **DO:**

- Use environment variables
- Use `.env` files (with `.gitignore`)
- Use secret management services (AWS Secrets Manager, HashiCorp Vault)
- Rotate keys regularly
- Use separate keys for dev/staging/production

### Proper Environment Variable Setup

**For Development:**

```bash
# ~/.zshrc or ~/.bash_profile
export OPENAI_API_KEY="sk-..."
export ANTHROPIC_API_KEY="sk-ant-..."
export GOOGLE_API_KEY="..."
```

**For Production:**

Use a secret management service:

- AWS Secrets Manager
- Google Cloud Secret Manager
- Azure Key Vault
- HashiCorp Vault
- Doppler
- 1Password Secrets Automation

### Using .env Files Safely

1. **Create .env file:**

   ```bash
   touch .env
   chmod 600 .env  # Restrict permissions
   ```

2. **Add to .gitignore:**

   ```bash
   echo ".env" >> .gitignore
   echo ".env.*" >> .gitignore
   echo "!.env.example" >> .gitignore
   ```

3. **Create .env.example template:**

   ```bash
   # .env.example (safe to commit)
   OPENAI_API_KEY=your-openai-key-here
   ANTHROPIC_API_KEY=your-anthropic-key-here
   GOOGLE_API_KEY=your-google-key-here
   ```

4. **Load in Python:**

   ```python
   from dotenv import load_dotenv
   load_dotenv()  # Loads .env file
   ```

## 📊 Impact Assessment

### What Could Happen with Exposed Key

- ✗ Unauthorized API usage (costs you money)
- ✗ Rate limit exhaustion
- ✗ Data exfiltration if used with your data
- ✗ Potential account suspension
- ✗ Compliance violations (if handling sensitive data)

### Monitoring for Unauthorized Usage

1. Check OpenAI usage dashboard:
   - <https://platform.openai.com/usage>

2. Look for:
   - Unusual spikes in usage
   - Requests from unknown IPs
   - Unexpected models being used
   - Activity during off-hours

3. Set up billing alerts:
   - <https://platform.openai.com/account/billing/limits>

## ✅ Verification Checklist

After taking action, verify:

- [ ] Old API key revoked on OpenAI platform
- [ ] New API key generated and stored securely
- [ ] Environment variables updated with new key
- [ ] `.env` file is in `.gitignore`
- [ ] No API keys in git history
- [ ] Billing alerts configured
- [ ] Usage dashboard checked for unauthorized activity
- [ ] Team members notified (if applicable)
- [ ] Incident documented

---

## 🔄 Key Rotation Schedule

Going forward, rotate API keys regularly:

- **Development keys:** Every 90 days
- **Production keys:** Every 30-60 days
- **After any security incident:** Immediately
- **When team members leave:** Immediately
