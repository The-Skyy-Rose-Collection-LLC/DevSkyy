# SkyyRose Social — Social Listening Plan

## When to Use This Skill

- Setting up systematic brand mention monitoring across Instagram, TikTok, X, Pinterest, and Reddit
- Building the keyword and hashtag tracking list for SkyyRose, The Skyy Rose Collection, and all four collections
- Designing the response workflow for what to do with what we find (positive mentions, complaints, purchase signals, competitor moves)
- Configuring Apify actors or free-tier tools (Google Alerts, native platform search) for listening automation
- Building the monthly social intelligence report template
- Auditing an existing listening setup for gaps

**DO NOT** use this for posting strategy or content creation (use `skyyrose-content-engine`), for crisis response once a crisis is active (use `skyyrose-social-crisis-comms`), or for community moderation within The Concrete Garden (use `skyyrose-social-community-moderation`). This is a monitoring and intelligence-gathering skill.

---

## Brand Canon (non-negotiable)

- **Monitor the brand, not just the handle.** Most SkyyRose mentions will be untagged — people write "SkyyRose" or "Skyy Rose" or "The Town's luxury brand" without the @. Untagged monitoring is as important as @mention tracking.
- **Oakland context is signal.** Mentions that pair Oakland/Bay Area with luxury streetwear, even without naming SkyyRose, are warm audience signals. The Town is the brand's home territory.
- **Tagline (exact) for search:** `Luxury Grows from Concrete` — use as a monitored phrase. Any mis-quote of the tagline is a signal that the brand is spreading but not precisely.
- **The Five visual references** define the competitive space we monitor. Kith, Oaklandish, Culture Kings, Fear of God, and Palm Angels represent our competitive adjacency — their audience conversations are intelligence. European luxury house (Bottega, Rick Owens, 032c) conversations are not our audience.
- **No hype-merchant response.** When we respond to a mention, it must be in Corey's voice: direct, specific, genuinely grateful or genuinely helpful. Not "🔥 Thanks for the love!! 🙌🙌."

## Phase 1: Brief

### Required Inputs

| Input | What to Ask | Default |
|-------|------------|---------|
| **Current monitoring setup** | Are you using any tools already? Google Alerts? Manually checking? | Manual, ad hoc |
| **Priority platforms** | Which platforms generate the most SkyyRose conversation? | Instagram, TikTok, X |
| **Competitor list** | Which 3-5 brands are we benchmarking against? | Kith, Oaklandish, Culture Kings + 2 others |
| **Listening goals** | Brand sentiment, competitor intelligence, purchase signals, UGC sourcing, all? | Brand mentions + purchase signals + UGC |
| **Budget** | Free tools only, or budget for paid monitoring tools? | Free tools priority; Apify for targeted scrapes |
| **Response owner** | Who acts on what we find — Corey, a social manager? | Corey + social lead |

**GATE: Confirm brief before building the plan.**

  Sources: Everything (web + news + blogs)

### Apify (targeted scrape runs — not always-on)
Use Apify actors for periodic deep-scrapes when manual monitoring finds a spike or
when running monthly competitive intelligence. Require Corey confirmation before
dispatching any paid Apify run.

Actor recommendations:
  - apify/instagram-scraper — for hashtag and profile mention scrapes
  - apify/tiktok-scraper — for keyword and hashtag TikTok pulls
  - apify/twitter-scraper-lite — for X/Twitter keyword volume pulls
  - apify/reddit-search-scraper — for subreddit keyword monitoring

Dispatch trigger: monthly intelligence report cycle OR when a listening spike
is detected in daily manual monitoring.
```

### 5. Response Workflow

```
## What to Do With What We Find

| Finding                              | Action                                              | Timeline          | Owner        |
|--------------------------------------|-----------------------------------------------------|-------------------|--------------|
| Positive brand mention (tagged)      | Like + genuine reply in Corey's voice; reshare to Stories with credit | Same day | Social lead |
| Positive brand mention (untagged)    | Reply to introduce the brand; ask permission to reshare | Same day | Social lead |
| Negative brand mention (tagged)      | Assess: valid complaint or troll? Valid → DM first, then public reply | Within 2 hours | Corey |
| Customer complaint gaining traction  | Escalate to Corey immediately; treat as L2 crisis   | Within 1 hour    | Corey        |
| Fit pic or customer photo (untagged) | DM for permission to reshare; log in UGC tracker   | Same day         | Social lead  |
| Purchase signal ("looking for...")   | Reply with a helpful, non-salesy recommendation (not "BUY NOW") | Same day | Social lead |
| Competitor weakness mentioned        | Log for positioning strategy; never trash-talk publicly | Log immediately | Corey |
| Competitor drop announcement         | Note timing for content calendar awareness          | Log immediately  | Social lead  |
| Industry trend gaining traction      | Add to content backlog with original source post    | Within the week  | Social lead  |
| Tagline mis-quote                    | Gentle reply with the correct tagline, not a correction | Within 24 hours | Social lead |
| Oakland/Bay Area streetwear conversation | Engage authentically; introduce SkyyRose only if it fits naturally | Same day | Social lead |

Response tone rule: Every response sounds like Corey — direct, specific, genuine.
Not "🔥 Thanks for the love!!" — not "We appreciate your feedback and will look into this."
Example positive reply: "Glad it landed right. That's the Black Rose — built exactly for that energy."
Example purchase signal reply: "If you're looking for luxury streetwear rooted in Oakland — we're it. skyyrose.co."

## Implementation

```python
from agents.social_media_agent import SocialMediaAgent

agent = SocialMediaAgent()

# Pull brand mention analytics from the agent's listening integrations
mentions = agent.get_analytics(
    metric="brand_mentions",
    platform="all",
    date_range="last_30_days",
    keywords=["SkyyRose", "Skyy Rose Collection", "Luxury Grows from Concrete"]
)
print(mentions.summary)
print(mentions.sentiment_breakdown)

# Pull purchase signal conversations for manual response queue
signals = agent.get_analytics(
    metric="purchase_signals",
    platform="twitter,instagram,reddit",
    keywords=["looking for luxury streetwear", "Black-owned streetwear Oakland"]
)
for signal in signals.results:
    print(f"{signal.platform} | {signal.author} | {signal.text[:120]}")

## Example: Listening During the Love Hurts Collection Pre-Order Window

**Scenario:** Love Hurts pre-order opens. Social listening detects:
1. A TikTok video (untagged): creator holds up the Love Hurts Jogger and says "this might be the best piece I've bought this year — SkyyRose is different"
2. X post: "anyone else waiting on their Love Hurts order? It's been 10 days and nothing shipped yet from skyyrose.co"
3. Reddit r/streetwear thread: "Best Black-owned streetwear brands right now?" — no SkyyRose mention

**Findings → Actions:**

TikTok (positive, untagged):
- DM the creator: "That Love Hurts piece was made for exactly that energy. Can we reshare this on our channels?" — Love Hurts register: raw passion, the bloodline. Not "Thanks for the love!! 🔥"
- Reshare to @skyyroseco with creator credit if permission granted.

X (complaint, tagged — treat as potential L2):
- Assess: shipping delay of 10 days on a pre-order? Confirm with Corey whether this is within expected window.
- If within window: reply publicly, direct to email for order status. Tone: direct, empathetic, no defensiveness.
- If actually delayed: escalate to Corey immediately. Treat as L2 crisis per `skyyrose-social-crisis-comms`.

Reddit (purchase signal — opportunity):
- Reply in r/streetwear thread with a genuine, non-salesy introduction: "SkyyRose out of Oakland — Black-owned, luxury streetwear rooted in The Town. Love Hurts collection is their signature for exactly this vibe: skyyrose.co/love-hurts"
- Do not over-pitch. One reply, specific, relevant.

**Love Hurts voice check:** Raw passion, the bloodline that raised us. Never cross into Black Rose (armor) or Signature (stay golden) language in these replies.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Monitoring only the handle (@skyyroseco)** — the majority of genuine brand conversation is untagged. Monitoring only @mentions misses 60-80% of real conversations.
- **Responding to every mention** — not every mention needs a response. Positive mentions get appreciation; purchase signals get a helpful reply; trolls get nothing. A social lead who replies to 100% of mentions burns time and dilutes the brand voice.
- **Trash-talking competitors** — when a competitor weakness surfaces in listening data, it goes into the positioning log, never into a public reply. "Why do people say Kith has gotten worse?" → log it, never quote-tweet it.
- **Hype-tone in responses** — "Thanks for the love!! 🔥🔥 We're so glad you love our product!!" is not SkyyRose. Every response should sound like Corey wrote it from the shop floor, not from a social media management app.
- **Monitoring without a response system** — listening that never generates action is wasted intelligence. Every signal type in the response workflow table must have an assigned owner and a response time.
- **Frequency mismatch** — checking brand mentions weekly instead of daily means a customer complaint spends 5 days unanswered. Tier 1 is daily, non-negotiable.
- **Apify running without approval** — Apify actors cost money. Per the STOP AND SHOW protocol, any Apify actor dispatch requires explicit Corey confirmation before execution.
- **Ignoring misspellings** — "SkyRose" and "Sky Rose" generate real brand mentions that won't surface if the monitoring queries only use exact "SkyyRose" spelling.
- **Treating Oakland/Bay Area conversation as noise** — "Oakland luxury brand" and "Bay Area streetwear" conversation is warm audience discovery, not irrelevant background noise. These are the people who find SkyyRose next.

---

## Recovery

- **No brand mentions found:** The brand may still be in early awareness phase. Shift focus to Tier 4 (Oakland/audience discovery) and Tier 5 (purchase signals). When people start finding the brand through community channels, Tier 1 volume follows.
- **Overwhelmed by mention volume after a viral moment:** Prioritize the response workflow triage table. Handle negative and purchase-signal mentions first; acknowledge positives in batches. Do not let the backlog grow past 24 hours without action.
- **Negative sentiment trending:** Identify the root cause from the listening data before drafting any response. Log the trend in the monthly report. If it constitutes a crisis (sustained negative spike), escalate to `skyyrose-social-crisis-comms`.
- **No budget for paid tools:** Google Alerts + platform native search + weekly Reddit manual scan covers the essential monitoring at zero cost. Apify is reserved for monthly deep-scrapes when specific intelligence is needed.
- **Listening data not translating into content ideas:** Review the monthly report's "Content ideas from listening" section with Corey. Real audience language from listening (what people call the brand, how they describe the pieces) is the raw material for captions, TikTok hooks, and product descriptions.
- **Response owner is a bottleneck:** If Corey is the only response owner and volume exceeds his capacity, create templated reply frameworks for the top 5 response types (positive tagged mention, positive untagged, purchase signal, Oakland discovery, shipping complaint). The social lead can execute against templates; Corey reviews exceptions.
