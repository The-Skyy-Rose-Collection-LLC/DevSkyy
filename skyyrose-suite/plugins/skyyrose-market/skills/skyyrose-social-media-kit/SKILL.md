# SkyyRose Social — Media Kit

## When to Use This Skill

- Responding to a journalist, editor, or podcast host who asks "can you send your media kit?"
- Preparing a media kit to attach to a PR pitch follow-up (after the journalist responds to the initial pitch)
- Building a partner-facing brand document for co-marketing conversations
- Refreshing the media kit for a new collection launch or milestone
- Creating collection-specific one-sheets for targeted fashion press

**DO NOT** use this as the first touchpoint with press — send the personalized pitch email first (`skyyrose-social-pr-pitch`), then the media kit on request. A media kit cold-sent as the opening move is amateur-hour PR. **DO NOT** use this as an influencer media kit — this skill builds the brand's outbound kit, not a creator's monetization kit.

---

## Brand Canon (non-negotiable)

- **Tagline (verbatim):** `Luxury Grows from Concrete.` — period included. The only tagline. Every version of this kit must carry it verbatim.
- **No fabricated stats, press placements, or awards.** All metric fields that require live data are marked `{operator-supplied}`. Do not fill them with invented numbers. The brand story is real — it doesn't need manufactured validation.
- **Founder:** Corey Foster. Oakland / Bay Area. Voice is earned, direct, unhurried — not a hype-merchant bio. The bio should read like a person, not a press release.
- **Products by NAME, not SKU** in all public-facing copy. "Black Rose Crewneck" in the one-sheet, not "br-001."
- **Collection voices are isolated.** Do not mix Black Rose copy into the Signature one-sheet. Each collection has its own register.
- **Hero titles = lockup IMAGES, not live type.** In the digital PDF, collection names in header positions use the official lockup image — not Cinzel or Archivo rendered as text.

## Phase 1: Confirm Scope

### Required Inputs

| Input | What to Confirm | Default |
|-------|----------------|---------|
| **Kit scope** | "Full brand kit, or collection-specific one-sheet?" | Full brand kit |
| **Target audience** | "Fashion press, streetwear media, co-marketing partner, or investor?" | Fashion press |
| **Format** | "PDF structure (for print/email) or Markdown (for digital/web)?" | PDF structure |
| **Metrics available** | "What operator-supplied figures can be included? (orders, social followers, founding year, etc.)" | Only what operator confirms |

**GATE: Confirm scope and available real metrics before producing the kit.**

---

## Phase 2: Build the Kit

### Artifact Specification

The SkyyRose brand media kit is a 5-7 page document with the following structure. Every section is specified below. Fields marked `{operator-supplied}` must be filled in by the operator with verified data before sending — do not invent values.

- Collection lockup (if featured): use official PNG from `assets/images/hero-overlays/` (BR/LH/SIG) or `assets/images/logos/` (Kids)

#### Brand Story (Page 2)

## About SkyyRose

SkyyRose — The Skyy Rose Collection — is an Oakland-born luxury streetwear brand
founded by Corey Foster. Built in The Town, worn beyond it.

"Luxury Grows from Concrete." is not a tagline borrowed from a mood board.
It is the founding truth: that craft, quality, and elevation can come from anywhere —
especially from places the fashion industry has historically overlooked.

SkyyRose launched in [Year: {operator-supplied}] with a single vision: to make luxury
streetwear that is rooted in Black culture, West Coast identity, and honest construction —
without a European house pedigree, without manufactured scarcity, and without urgency tricks.

Four collections. One city. No apology.

#### Founder Bio (Page 3)

```
## Corey Foster — Founder & Creative Director

[Founder photo — editorial, not a headshot. Oakland setting preferred.]

Corey Foster is the founder and creative director of SkyyRose — The Skyy Rose Collection.

[Bio text: operator-authored from actual founder voice. Do NOT generate a generic founder bio.
Source from: knowledge-base/seed/from-interview.md — the verbatim founder interview.
The bio should reflect Corey's specific Oakland story, the brand name origin (named for
his daughter Skyy Rose), and the "Luxury Grows from Concrete." founding principle.
Voice: direct, specific, earned. Never hype-merchant. Never "visionary entrepreneur who...]

[Suggested structure — operator fills in:]
- Oakland anchor / where the brand comes from geographically and personally
- What problem the brand is solving (luxury streetwear gap in the Bay Area)
- The brand name origin
- Where the brand is going

**Quote (direct from founder, operator-supplied):**
"{operator-supplied — verbatim Corey quote for press use}"

### Press Contact

```

**Rules for the bio:**
- The founder bio in this kit must be sourced from the actual interview, not AI-drafted from scratch
- Read `knowledge-base/seed/from-interview.md` to pull the correct voice and facts
- Do not invent backstory, press milestones, or awards

---

#### Collection One-Sheets (Pages 4-7, one per collection)

Each collection gets its own page. Use only the register for that collection — never cross-attribute.

black_rose = agent.get_collection_context("black-rose")
print(black_rose["full_name"])     # collection display name for the one-sheet header
print(black_rose["caption_hooks"]) # on-register lines to draw the one-sheet copy from
print(black_rose["hashtags"])      # collection hashtag set for the press asset list

# Pull a catalog-correct product blurb in the collection register
post = agent.generate_post("br-001", "instagram", "product_launch")
print(post.caption)                # one-sheet product description, brand voice

## Example: Black Rose Collection Press Kit for Hypebeast Outreach

**Scenario:** A Hypebeast writer responded to the PR pitch and requested the media kit. The kit is Black Rose-scoped (collection-specific), 4 pages: cover, brand story + founder bio condensed, Black Rose one-sheet with Black Rose Crewneck as the featured product, and brand asset spec.

**Cover:** Dark background, Black Rose lockup image, `Luxury Grows from Concrete.`, `Oakland, California`, `skyyrose.co`.

**Brand story (condensed for collection kit):** 2 paragraphs — the founding truth, the Oakland anchor, and the Black Rose register in one line: "Armor for the ones who are still standing."

**Founder bio:** Pulled directly from `knowledge-base/seed/from-interview.md`. Corey's Oakland story, the Skyy Rose name origin, the founding vision. One verbatim quote operator-supplied.

**Black Rose one-sheet:** Black Rose lockup image (PNG from `assets/images/hero-overlays/`), Silver accent, "Gothic luxury. Armor. Defiant elegance." register, Black Rose Crewneck featured with catalog-sourced description and price.

**Asset spec:** Logo formats available, usage guidelines, credit line.

**What is NOT in this kit:** Fabricated press placements, invented follower counts, made-up "as seen in" logos. The brand stands on its story — that is sufficient for press outreach.

---

## Anti-Patterns

- **Sending the media kit as the first press touchpoint** — the pitch comes first. The kit is a follow-up document. Cold-sending a PDF signals that you don't know how PR works.
- **Fabricating press placements** — "As seen in Vogue" when you haven't been. Journalists verify. One fake placement destroys all credibility.
- **Filling in metric fields with estimates or aspirational numbers** — use `{operator-supplied}` and actually fill them in with verified data, or omit the row. Never write "~10K orders" if you don't know.
- **Cross-attributing collection voices on the one-sheets** — the Black Rose page must not use Love Hurts language. Each page is its own emotional register.
- **Rendering collection names as live type in the PDF design** — the lockup images exist for this reason. Placing "Black Rose" in Cinzel as a heading is a brand violation.
- **A generic founder bio generated from nothing** — the bio must be sourced from the actual interview. Read `knowledge-base/seed/from-interview.md`. Do not draft a bio from training data.
- **Making the kit longer than 7 pages** — press is busy. Everything needed is in 5-7 pages maximum. A 15-page brand bible is not a media kit.
- **Referencing products by SKU** — "br-001 Crewneck" in a press kit is unprofessional. Always use the full product name.
- **Listing European luxury houses as visual references** — this kit explicitly names Kith, Oaklandish, Culture Kings, Fear of God, and Palm Angels as the reference lane. Not Bottega, not Numéro, not Rick Owens.

---

## Recovery

- **Journalist asks for the kit but no real stats are ready yet:** Send the kit with `{operator-supplied}` fields removed rather than invented. A story-first kit without metrics is honest and still useful. Add the community section with real customer quotes if available.
- **Founding year or other basic facts are uncertain:** Ask the operator. Do not guess. Basic brand facts (founding year, price range) must be accurate.
- **Journalist wants a collection-specific one-pager instead of the full kit:** Build the collection one-sheet (one page) from the artifact spec above — cover + one-sheet + asset spec. Trim to 2-3 pages.
- **Kit needs to be updated for a new drop:** Refresh the collection one-sheets with the new product names and descriptions pulled from the catalog. Bump the version number in the tracker schema. Do not update metrics fields unless operator confirms new verified numbers.
- **No press coverage exists to include:** Omit the Press Highlights section entirely. Replace with Community if real customer quotes are available. Do not create a placeholder section — an empty press section is worse than no press section.
