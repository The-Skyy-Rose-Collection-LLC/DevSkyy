# SkyyRose Product Copy System

## When to Use This Skill

- Writing new WooCommerce product descriptions for skyyrose.co
- Improving existing product copy that lacks brand voice
- Writing collection page descriptions (Black Rose, Love Hurts, Signature, Kids Capsule)
- Generating product FAQs to reduce pre-purchase hesitation
- Optimizing product SEO (titles, meta descriptions, alt text)
- Creating pre-order product copy with exclusivity (never urgency timers)
- Generating WC REST API-ready JSON payloads for programmatic updates

**DO NOT** use for ad copy (use `skyyrose-paid-media`), email copy (use `skyyrose-email-flows`), or social captions (use `skyyrose-content-engine`).

---

## CRITICAL: Catalog-First Product Resolution

**NEVER use memory, never invent product facts. Every product claim MUST trace to a verified source.**

Resolution order (strict — do not skip steps):

1. **Catalog CSV** — `/Users/theceo/DevSkyy/wordpress-theme/skyyrose-flagship/data/skyyrose-catalog.csv`
   Columns: `sku, name, price, collection, description, badge, image, front_model_image, back_image, back_model_image, sizes, color, edition_size, published, is_preorder, branding_spec, render_output_slug, render_source_override, render_back_source_override, render_is_tech_flat, render_is_accessory, garment_type_lock, dossier_slug, engine_override`

2. **Per-SKU dossier** — `/Users/theceo/DevSkyy/wordpress-theme/skyyrose-flagship/data/dossiers/{dossier_slug}.md`
   Contains: construction details, gsm/material, narrative canon, founder intent. The dossier is Corey-authored — its words are the source of truth.

3. **User confirmation** — if a fact is absent from CSV + dossier, flag it with `[NEEDS: <fact>]` and proceed. Never fill the gap with invention.

**The lh-005 hallucination ("fanny-pack" → invented specs) was caused by skipping this check. It will not recur.**

Delivery file convention: `{sku}-product-copy.md` saved alongside the dossier, or returned inline as a structured block. The WC REST payload section at the end is always included for copy-paste into WooCommerce admin or API scripts.

## Brand Voice Quick Reference

| Element | Rule |
|---------|------|
| Tone | Luxury but grounded, poetic but never pretentious |
| Tagline | "Luxury Grows from Concrete." (period is mandatory) |
| NEVER say | "high-quality", "affordable luxury", "premium", "exclusive" as standalone filler |
| ALWAYS show | Weight (gsm), construction (double-stitched), material specifics from dossier |
| Oakland anchor | "The Town" for Oakland-specific; "Bay Area" is acceptable for regional references |
| Pre-order language | "Limited to X pieces" — NEVER urgency timers, NEVER "Pre-order now" |
| Reading level | 8th grade — short sentences, sensory language, active voice |
| Cross-sell | NONE on PDP. No "Complete the Look", no related products. Garment is the protagonist. |
| Visual refs | The Five: Kith, Oaklandish, Culture Kings, Fear of God, Palm Angels |
| NEVER cite | European luxury houses (Bottega, Rick Owens, Acne, Givenchy, 032c) — wrong DNA |

### Collection Voices — Never Cross-Attribute

| Collection | Voice Register | Accent Color | Canonical Mood |
|-----------|---------------|-------------|----------------|
| **Black Rose** | Defiant, armor, midnight elegance | Silver `#C0C0C0` | "concrete answering back" / "beauty that grows where it shouldn't" |
| **Love Hurts** | Bloodline, passionate, emotionally raw | Crimson `#DC143C` | "Bloodline that raised me" — *Love Hurts ONLY* |
| **Signature** | Confident, golden, West Coast swagger | Gold `#D4AF37` | "stay golden" / "where the fog meets the gold" |
| **Kids Capsule** | Playful, empowering, little royalty | Rose Gold `#B76E79` | "little royalty, big energy" |

Collection names in hero sections = lockup PNG assets (`assets/images/hero-overlays/` or `assets/images/logos/`). Never type-render collection names in hero copy.

## WooCommerce REST API Field Map

This table is the canonical bridge between editorial decisions and the WC REST API write payload.
API base: `{site}/wp-json/wc/v3/products/{id}` (POST/PUT). Auth: Basic + consumer key/secret.

| Editorial Field | WC REST Field | Type | Constraint |
|----------------|--------------|------|-----------|
| Product title | `name` | string | 70 chars SEO sweet spot |
| Full description (story + specs) | `description` | HTML string | 300–600 words; wrap in `<p>`, `<ul>`, `<strong>` |
| Above-fold hook | `short_description` | HTML string | 150–200 chars; 1–2 sentences |
| URL slug | `slug` | string | keyword-rich, e.g. `black-rose-hoodie` |
| Price | `regular_price` | string (not number) | e.g. `"40"` — WC requires strings |
| Sale price | `sale_price` | string | `""` when no sale |
| SKU | `sku` | string | From catalog CSV — never invented |
| Collection taxonomy | `categories` | array of `{id: int}` | WC category IDs; resolve via `/wc/v3/products/categories` |
| Product images | `images` | array of `{id, src, alt, name}` | See Image Alt Text section below |
| Variable sizes / colorways | `attributes` | array (see Variable Products section) | |
| SEO title (Yoast) | `meta_data` → key `_yoast_wpseo_title` | `{key, value}` | 60 chars |
| SEO meta desc (Yoast) | `meta_data` → key `_yoast_wpseo_metadesc` | `{key, value}` | 155 chars |
| SEO title (Rank Math) | `meta_data` → key `rank_math_title` | `{key, value}` | 60 chars |
| SEO meta desc (Rank Math) | `meta_data` → key `rank_math_description` | `{key, value}` | 155 chars |
| schema.org material | `meta_data` → key `_schema_material` (or dossier-driven) | `{key, value}` | Plain text, e.g. "French terry 380gsm" |
| schema.org color | `meta_data` → key `_schema_color` | `{key, value}` | From CSV `color` column |
| schema.org size | surfaced via `attributes` `pa_size` | — | Drives JSON-LD `SizeSpecification` |
| FAQ content | `meta_data` → key `_product_faq` (or plugin-specific) | JSON or HTML | 3–5 Q&A pairs |

**STOP-AND-SHOW required** before any WC REST write, media upload, or Klaviyo send. Show exact endpoint, payload, and cost before executing.

### Image Alt Text — First-Class Field

Image alt text is not a footnote. It is a first-class accessibility + SEO field submitted with every image object.

Format: `[Product name] [view] — [one distinguishing detail]`

Examples:
- `"Black Rose Hoodie front view — embroidered rose script on heavyweight black French terry"`
- `"Love Hurts Bomber Jacket back view — large heart-and-rose logo centered on satin body"`
- `"The Fannie front view — heart-and-rose logo at dot of the I in FANNIE"`

Rules:
- Max 125 chars
- Include the product name (matches `name` field)
- Include the view (front / back / detail / flat)
- Include one physical distinguishing detail from the dossier
- Never use the SKU as the alt text

WC REST images array example:
```json
"images": [
  {
    "src": "https://skyyrose.co/wp-content/uploads/br-004-black-rose-hoodie.jpeg",
    "alt": "Black Rose Hoodie front view — embroidered rose script on heavyweight black French terry",
    "name": "Black Rose Hoodie — Front"
  },
  {
    "src": "https://skyyrose.co/wp-content/uploads/black-rose-hoodie-back-model.webp",
    "alt": "Black Rose Hoodie back view — clean black French terry, ribbed hem",
    "name": "Black Rose Hoodie — Back"
  }
]
```

---

## Variable Products — Sizes and Colorways

When a product has multiple sizes or colorways, use WC attributes. Jersey series colorways (br-003 baseball classic variants: Black, Oakland, Giants, White) and Kids Capsule colorblock sets (kids-001 Red/Black, kids-002 Purple/Black) are examples.

### Simple products (single color, multiple sizes)

Most SkyyRose products: set `type: "simple"`, populate `attributes` with size only.

```json
"attributes": [
  {
    "name": "Size",
    "slug": "pa_size",
    "position": 0,
    "visible": true,
    "variation": false,
    "options": ["S", "M", "L", "XL", "2XL", "3XL"]
  }
]
```
Sizes are sourced from the CSV `sizes` column (pipe-delimited: `S|M|L|XL|2XL|3XL`).

### Variable products (multiple colorways)

For products with distinct colorways (e.g., br-003 baseball classic series), set `type: "variable"` on the parent and create child variations.

```json
"attributes": [
  {
    "name": "Size",
    "slug": "pa_size",
    "position": 0,
    "visible": true,
    "variation": true,
    "options": ["S", "M", "L", "XL", "2XL", "3XL"]
  },
  {
    "name": "Colorway",
    "slug": "pa_colorway",
    "position": 1,
    "visible": true,
    "variation": true,
    "options": ["Black", "Oakland", "Giants", "White"]
  }
]
```

Each child variation carries its own `regular_price`, `sku` (e.g., `br-003-black`), `images`, and `attributes` with the specific option values. Edition sizes (e.g., 80 pieces for jersey series) belong on the variation `stock_quantity` when `manage_stock: true`.

Kids Capsule sizes use the child-sizing scale from the CSV (`2T|3T|4T|5|6|7`) — never adult sizing.

---

## Core Workflow

### Phase 1: Gather Product Intelligence

For every product, read in this order:
1. **Catalog CSV** — resolve `sku`, `name`, `price`, `collection`, `sizes`, `color`, `edition_size`, `is_preorder`, `branding_spec`
2. **Dossier** — resolve construction details (gsm, material, stitch spec, placement), narrative canon, founder intent
3. **User input** — any additional context (launch date, special run, Corey's words)

If a required fact is missing from both CSV and dossier, flag it: `[NEEDS: fabric weight]`. Never invent.

### Phase 2: Write the Product Listing

Generate every element in this order:

**1. Product Title**
```
[Collection] [Product Name] — [Key Differentiator]
```
Examples:
- "Black Rose Hoodie — Heavyweight 380gsm French Terry"
- "Love Hurts Varsity Jacket — Full-Grain Leather Sleeves"
- "The Bridge Series 'The Bay Bridge' Shorts — Sublimated Edition"

**2. Short Description (WC `short_description`)**
One to two sentences. Benefit first, then the sensory hook. Delivered as HTML.

Black Rose example:
> Heavyweight French terry that drops like armor. Double-stitched seams, ribbed cuffs, embroidered Black Rose script across the chest.

Love Hurts example:
> Full-grain leather sleeves meet wool-blend body in a varsity silhouette that doesn't ask permission. Chenille "Love Hurts" patch. Hand-finished details throughout.

Signature example:
> Golden hour trapped in cotton. Mint and lavender colorblock hoodie with brushed fleece interior and rose gold hardware.

**3. Long Description (WC `description`)**

```
[Opening hook — 1-2 sentences that set the scene]

[The story — why this piece exists, what it represents]

[Construction details — material, weight, stitching, hardware — sourced from dossier]

[Fit and sizing — how it wears, what to expect]

[Pre-order / exclusivity callout if applicable — no urgency timers]

[CTA — specific, not generic]
```

**4. SEO Elements**
- SEO Title: `[Primary Keyword] — [Brand] | [Collection]` (60 chars)
- Meta Description: 155 chars, benefit + keyword + subtle CTA
- Image alt text per image: see Image Alt Text section above
- URL slug: `/product/[keyword-slug]/`
- SEO fields delivered as `meta_data` array entries (Yoast or Rank Math keys)

**5. Product FAQ (3–5 questions)**
Standard questions to address:
- What's the fabric/material?
- How does it fit? (true to size, oversized, etc.)
- When will pre-orders ship?
- Is this a limited release?
- How do I care for this piece?

### Phase 3: Polish

Run this checklist before delivering:

| Check | Verify |
|-------|--------|
| CSV + dossier sourced | Every fact traces to catalog CSV or dossier — no memory, no invention |
| Collection voice match | Copy sounds like Black Rose / Love Hurts / Signature / Kids — voices not crossed |
| Benefits lead features | Every bullet starts with what you FEEL, not what it IS |
| No unproven superlatives | Zero "best", "#1", "world-class" without proof |
| Sensory language present | Weight, texture, drape, feel are mentioned |
| Pre-order handled correctly | Limited quantity communicated; no urgency timers |
| SEO complete | Title (60c), meta (155c), alt (125c), slug all present |
| Character limits met | All fields within WC limits |
| No banned phrases | No "high-quality", "affordable luxury", "premium" as filler |
| CTA is specific | "Claim yours" beats "Add to cart" |
| Oakland/Bay reference | Natural cultural reference where authentic to the piece |
| No cross-sell on PDP | Zero "Complete the Look", zero related products |
| Image alt text | Every image object has a populated `alt` — not empty, not the SKU |

### Phase 4: Deliver

Output structure for every product:

1. **Editorial preview** — formatted copy for human review
2. **WC REST API payload** — copy-paste JSON block with all fields populated
3. **Delivery path** — `{sku}-product-copy.md` saved to the project dossiers dir if writing to file

<p>Heavyweight French terry that drops like armor. Double-stitched seams, ribbed cuffs, embroidered Black Rose script across the chest. Built in The Town. Limited pre-order.</p>
```

### Long Description
```html
<p>Some hoodies you wear. This one wears a reputation.</p>

<p>The Black Rose Hoodie is 380gsm French terry — dense enough to cut wind, soft enough to live in. The kind of weight that reminds you it's there every time you move. Every seam is double-stitched. The ribbed cuffs hold their shape season after season. The Black Rose script across the chest is embroidered, not printed — because print fades. Embroidery doesn't.</p>

<p>This is the Black Rose Collection: dark, deliberate, Oakland to the core. Named for the beauty that grows where it shouldn't. Where others see concrete, we see potential.</p>

<p><strong>CONSTRUCTION</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>380gsm French terry (heavyweight — this is not a fast-fashion fleece)</li>
<li>Double-stitched seams throughout</li>
<li>Embroidered Black Rose script — front chest</li>
<li>Ribbed cuffs and hem</li>
<li>Brushed interior</li>
<li>Kangaroo pocket with reinforced edges</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>FIT</strong><br>Relaxed fit, true to size. If you want oversized, size up one.</p>

<p><strong>PRE-ORDER</strong><br>Limited release. Once they're gone, they're gone. Ships within 4–6 weeks of order close.</p>

<p>This isn't just a hoodie. It's what luxury looks like when it grows from concrete.</p>

### Product FAQ
```
Q: What's the fabric weight?
A: 380gsm French terry — significantly heavier than standard hoodies (typically 250–280gsm). You'll feel the difference immediately.

Q: How does it fit?
A: Relaxed fit, true to size. For an oversized silhouette, go up one size.

Q: When does my pre-order ship?
A: Pre-orders ship within 4–6 weeks of the order window closing. You'll receive tracking via email.

Q: Is this a limited release?
A: Yes. Once pre-order quantities are reached, this run is closed. We don't do restocks on every drop.

Q: How do I care for this hoodie?
A: Machine wash cold, inside out. Tumble dry low or hang dry. The embroidery is built to last — no special treatment needed.

### Below-Grid SEO Description (200–300 words)
[Story → what's included → how to choose → internal links]

### Meta Title / Description
[SEO-optimized with collection keywords]
```

**Collection hero name = lockup PNG asset. Do not type-render the collection name.**

### Black Rose Collection Page Example

**H1:** "Black Rose Collection — Dark Elegance from The Town"

**Intro:** "The Black Rose Collection is midnight given form. Built for those who find beauty in darkness and wear their Oakland roots like armor. Limited edition streetwear that doesn't whisper — it announces."

**Below-Grid Description:**
"Every piece in the Black Rose Collection carries the same DNA: heavyweight construction, dark palettes, and details that reveal themselves over time. From the signature Black Rose Hoodie to the limited-edition jersey series celebrating Bay Area sports culture, Black Rose is where luxury streetwear meets Oakland identity.

The jersey series — limited to 80 pieces each — draws from the Bay's sports legacy: SF-inspired (football), Last Oakland (football), The Bay (basketball), The Rose (hockey), and Last Oakland Baseball. Each features the exclusive 'BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL' design with alternating rose-filled numbers and collection-specific patches.

Whether you're starting with the Black Rose Crewneck or going all-in on the Sherpa Jacket, every piece is built to layer, built to last, and built to be seen.

## Anti-Patterns

- **DO NOT** write generic product copy — "This comfortable hoodie is made with quality materials" could be any brand
- **DO NOT** lead with features — "100% cotton" means nothing without "Softer than anything in your closet"
- **DO NOT** use "affordable luxury" — SkyyRose IS luxury. Period.
- **DO NOT** skip the cultural reference — every collection is rooted in a place and a story
- **DO NOT** write walls of text — use line breaks, bullets, sections for scannable listings
- **DO NOT** use generic CTAs — "Claim yours" beats "Add to cart"
- **DO NOT** fabricate specs — if you don't know the gsm or material, flag it with `[NEEDS: fabric weight]`
- **DO NOT** skip pre-order status — every pre-order product must communicate limited availability
- **DO NOT** add urgency timers or countdown language — founder rule, not a stylistic preference
- **DO NOT** reference related products or cross-sells on PDP — garment is the protagonist
- **DO NOT** cross-attribute collection voices — "bloodline" is Love Hurts ONLY; "armor/concrete" is Black Rose ONLY
- **DO NOT** leave image `alt` fields empty — every image object in the API payload must have alt populated
- **DO NOT** use the SKU as the product title or alt text — products are named from the catalog
- **DO NOT** cite European luxury houses as visual references — use The Five only

---

## Recovery

- **User gives minimal product info:** Read the catalog CSV first. Resolve name, collection, price, sizes from CSV. Read dossier for construction. Only ask if CSV + dossier are both silent on a required fact.
- **Unknown fabric/material specs:** Write around the gap with sensory language and flag `[NEEDS: material specs]`. Never invent a gsm number.
- **Product doesn't fit a collection voice:** Default to Signature voice (most versatile) and note for user review.
- **Existing copy needs improvement:** Read current copy, identify top 3 weaknesses, rewrite with before/after comparison.
- **Variable product with colorways:** Use the `attributes` + `type: "variable"` pattern above. Source colorway names from CSV `color` column.
- **Kids Capsule sizing:** Use `2T|3T|4T|5|6|7` from CSV — never substitute adult sizing.
- **SEO plugin unknown:** Deliver both Yoast (`_yoast_wpseo_*`) and Rank Math (`rank_math_*`) keys in `meta_data` — only one set will be active; the other is ignored by WC.
