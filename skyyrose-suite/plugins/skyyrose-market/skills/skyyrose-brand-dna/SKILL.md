## The Founder's Story

**Corey Foster** — CEO/Owner, single father, entrepreneur

The Skyy Rose Collection was born out of a deeply personal experience — Corey's resolve to provide a better life for his daughter, **Skyy Rose**, after whom the brand is named. As a single father raising a child in one of Oakland's crime-ridden neighborhoods, Corey was determined not to become another statistic.

> "If you asked me four years ago, I never would have thought I'd be here. I had no drive, lost it all, a baby on the way, and was broke. But we knew we had to get it by any means necessary."

**The Journey:**
- Dealt with doubts, losing loved ones, feeling like he had nothing left to give
- Navigated multiple failed website attempts
- Overcame deceitful manufacturers who promised much but delivered little
- Balanced single parenthood with entrepreneurship on minimal to no support
- Maintained integrity, steering clear from paths that lead many astray in his community

**Philosophy:** *"Believe in your vision even when others can't see it."*

**Recognition:**
- Maxim's "14 Game-Changing Entrepreneurs To Watch In 2023"
- Featured entrepreneur on The Blox
- Best of Best Review: Best Bay Area Clothing Line Award 2024
- Featured in San Francisco Post, CEO Weekly

## The Collections

Each collection is its **own emotional register**. Never cross-attribute voices, quotes, or visual language across collections. For the full canonical line library per collection, read `docs/brand/collection-stories.md`.

### Black Rose Collection

**Slug:** `love-hurts`

## Hero Titles — Lockup Images, Never Type-Rendered

> **Cross-reference:** `brand-guardrails.md § 4` has the full lockup rule with asset paths.

A collection's **name** in any hero / cover / title position is a brand-script **lockup image**, not live typeset text. Fonts (Archivo, Hanken Grotesk, Anton, Cinzel) apply only to interior surfaces — body copy, captions, slide subtext, UI labels — **never** to the collection name itself. The lockup IS the name.

| Collection | Lockup asset location |
|------------|----------------------|
| Black Rose | `assets/images/hero-overlays/br-brand-script.png` |
| Love Hurts | `assets/images/hero-overlays/lh-logo-combined.png` |
| Signature | `assets/images/hero-overlays/sig-brand-skyy-rose-gold.png` |
| Kids Capsule | `assets/images/logos/` (Kids Capsule lockup) |

---

## Visual Identity

**Color Palette:**

| Token | Hex | Usage |
|-------|-----|-------|
| Dark (background) | `#0A0A0A` | Global page background |
| Pure white | `#FFFFFF` | Text on dark, structural contrast |
| Rose Gold (global accent) | `#B76E79` | Global accent, Kids Capsule collection accent |
| Gold (Signature) | `#D4AF37` | Signature Collection accent |
| Crimson (Love Hurts) | `#DC143C` | Love Hurts Collection accent |
| Silver (Black Rose) | `#C0C0C0` | Black Rose Collection accent |
| Blood red | `#8B0000` | Supporting dark red for graphic elements |
| Charcoal | `#1C1C1C` | Secondary surface, card backgrounds |
| Smoke | `#2D2D2D` | Tertiary surface, elevated panel backgrounds |

**Typography System:**

| Role | Font | Notes |
|------|------|-------|
| Display / hero / headings (interior, ALL collections) | Archivo | Display sans, expanded width — NEVER for collection name lockup |
| Editorial body | Hanken Grotesk | Long-form copy, product narrative |
| UI / system | Inter | System fallback — interface, navigation, system text |
| Prices / technical data | Space Mono | Numbers, SKU-adjacent UI |
| Buttons / labels | Anton | CTA text, tag labels, caps, drop accent |
| Engraved-caps accent (optional) | Cinzel | Generic engraved-caps accent — NEVER for collection name lockup |
| Collection NAME (hero / cover / title) | Lockup image only — SkyyRose Black Rose Script (BR), SkyyRose Love Hurts Graffiti (LH), Pinyon Script (SIG), Grand Hotel (KC) | Never live type |

All 9 font families are declared in `theme.json` via WordPress Font Library. Zero external CDN (Google Fonts removed).

**Photography Direction:**

> **Cross-reference:** `brand-guardrails.md § 2` — The Five visual references govern all visual direction. Pull from Kith, Oaklandish, Culture Kings, Fear of God, Palm Angels. NEVER European luxury-house lineage.

- Lighting: Dramatic, directional, cinematic
- Settings: Urban Oakland, industrial spaces, elevated environments
- Models: Confident, diverse, authentic, inclusive of all genders
- Styling: Intentional, layered, statement-making

---

## Voice & Tone

**Brand Voice Characteristics:**
- Confident without arrogance
- Rooted in fatherhood and family
- Oakland-authentic, globally aware
- Emotionally intelligent
- Never corporate or generic

**Writing Guidelines:**
- Lead with emotion, follow with features
- Reference the origin story when appropriate
- Short, impactful sentences
- Emphasize quality, craftsmanship, sustainability
- Say "The Town" when Oakland-specific; "Bay Area" is acceptable but Oakland-first is preferred
- Avoid: "premium," "exclusive" as standalone descriptors — show, don't tell
- Reference products by **NAME, not SKU** in any customer-facing copy. "BLACK Rose Crewneck" not "br-001". SKUs are internal identifiers; SKU-first phrasing has caused product conflations.

**Example Product Description:**
```
BLACK ROSE HEAVYWEIGHT TEE
Built for those who move through darkness like it's home.
Double-stitched seams. 280gsm cotton. Oakland-made mentality.
This isn't fast fashion. This is armor.
```

## Canonical Tagline

> **`Luxury Grows from Concrete.`**

The period is part of the tagline. This is the **only** tagline. Never paraphrase:
- "luxury from the streets" = WRONG
- "grown from concrete" = WRONG
- "Luxury grows from the concrete" (no period, no capital C) = WRONG

---

## Key Brand Messages

- "Luxury Grows from Concrete." (only tagline — verbatim with period)
- "Where fashion meets emotion"
- "Redefine luxury fashion"
- "Sustainably crafted, limited edition designs"
- Named after a daughter, built by a father
- From losing everything to building an award-winning brand

---

## Target Customer

- Age: All ages (including children's line)
- Gender: All — pioneer in gender-neutral Bay Area streetwear
- Values quality over quantity, fashion as expression
- Appreciates founder story and authenticity
- Supports Black-owned, independent businesses
- Parents who want matching fits with their kids

---

## Founder Canon — What We NEVER Do

> **Cross-reference:** Full list in `brand-guardrails.md § 5`. The rules below are non-negotiable.

- **No urgency timers / countdown-pressure manipulation.** Scarcity stated as fact ("limited to pre-order", "250 made"), never a ticking clock.
- **No related-products / "complete the look" cross-sell on PDPs.** The garment is the protagonist. One piece, one story. (`woocommerce.php:541` hook commented out; do not reactivate without founder sign-off.)
- **No hype-merchant tone.** Corey's register: earned, specific, Oakland-direct. No "🔥🔥 DON'T MISS OUT 🔥🔥".
- **No European luxury-house aesthetic framing.** Wrong brand DNA (see The Five in `brand-guardrails.md § 2`).
- **No invented products or colorways.** Every product fact resolves through the canonical catalog CSV + per-SKU dossier (see section below). Never memory, never imagination.

---

## Canonical Product Source

> **Cross-reference:** `brand-guardrails.md § 6` has the full canonical source protocol.

Product facts — name, collection, price, description, colorway — resolve through:

1. **Catalog CSV:** `wordpress-theme/skyyrose-flagship/data/skyyrose-catalog.csv` (33 SKUs)
2. **Per-SKU dossiers:** `skyyrose/elite_studio/assets/` per-product directories
3. **Live agent (for social copy):** `SocialMediaAgent` → `skyyrose/assets/data/product-content.json`

**Never invent a product, colorway, or detail.** If catalog data is absent, surface the gap — do not fill it with inference. (This rule traces to the lh-005 fanny-pack hallucination incident, 2026-05-27.)

Dossiers are Corey-authored from the actual product; do not draft dossier content via ML without founder review.

## STOP-AND-SHOW Confirmation Gates

The following actions require an explicit confirmation manifest + `y` from the user before execution:

| Action | Gate |
|--------|------|
| Any paid API call (FASHN, Gemini image-gen, FLUX, Replicate) | STOP AND SHOW cost + files |
| Klaviyo send (any list, any email) | STOP AND SHOW audience + template |
| WooCommerce REST write (create/update/delete product, order, media) | STOP AND SHOW exact payload |
| WordPress Media Library upload | STOP AND SHOW file + destination |
| Deploy to skyyrose.co (`deploy-theme.sh` / SFTP) | STOP AND SHOW manifest |

"Autonomous" means Claude handles implementation after confirmation. It does NOT mean Claude decides what to spend or deploy without checking first.
