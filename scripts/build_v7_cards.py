"""build_v7_cards.py — Generate the V7 lookbook card store as a DERIVED VIEW.

``wordpress-theme/skyyrose-flagship/data/v7-cards.json`` was previously a
hand-maintained file — the last product-data store in the repo not tied to a
single source of truth. It carried catalog fields (name / price / badge /
preorder) copied by hand from the CSV, which let it drift (it inherited the
br-014/br-015 ``badge="Pre-Order"`` vs ``is_preorder=0`` contradiction verbatim).

This generator makes it a GENERATED VIEW joining two authorities:

  * Catalog fields (name, price, collection, badge, edition, preorder)
        → the product SOT: ``skyyrose-catalog.csv`` (via ``skyyrose.core.catalog_loader``).
  * Imagery (which SKUs qualify + their shot files)
        → the tracked, promoted V7 served tree
          ``wordpress-theme/skyyrose-flagship/assets/images/products/v7/<sku>/``.
          A SKU earns a card iff it has a promoted ``front`` shot there. That tree
          is the served projection of the asset-hub ``verdict:verified`` gate
          (see ``feedback_real_products_only``); gating on the tracked tree keeps
          this generator runnable in CI and fresh clones, where the hub manifest
          (``assets/hub/manifest.json``) is gitignored and absent.

``preorder`` is therefore a COMPUTED field — it can no longer disagree with the
CSV. The companion validator check ``v7_cards_current`` regenerates into a buffer
and fails CI if the committed file drifts from this generator's output, closing
the recurrence hole.

Stdlib-only + ``skyyrose.core.catalog_loader`` so it runs in the catalog-validate
CI job (no project install).

USAGE:
  python scripts/build_v7_cards.py            # regenerate the file in place
  python scripts/build_v7_cards.py --check    # exit 1 if the committed file is stale (no write)
  python scripts/build_v7_cards.py --stdout    # print generated JSON, do not write
