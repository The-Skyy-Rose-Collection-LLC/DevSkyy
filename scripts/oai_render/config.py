# then a cheap VLM judge. The HARD_COST_CAP_USD above guards the manifest
# ESTIMATE; the SpendTracker in cost.py enforces the same cap against ACTUAL
# accumulated spend (renders + judged retries + judge calls) at runtime, which
# closes the retry-storm gap (worst case previously ~$189 vs the $50 cap).

# directions: it hallucinated defects (green that wasn't there), false-PASSED a
# missing-sherpa-lining render, and false-REJECTED good renders. Root cause:
# detail:"low" downsamples to ~512px / 85 image tokens, so the judge cannot resolve
# logo art, colorway, or material — exactly the gates it must enforce. A wrong verdict
# costs a wasted $0.40 render (or discards good work); the few-cent token cost of a
# capable judge at full detail is trivial by comparison. gpt-4.1 keeps the existing
# chat.completions + max_tokens + json_schema call shape (GPT-5.x would need
# max_completion_tokens); detail:"high" lets it actually see the garment.
# Provider: "anthropic" (Claude-class vision — reliable) | "openai" (gpt-* — proven
# UNRELIABLE on fine garment/colorway perception). The ground-truth eval harness

# (gpt-4o-mini, gpt-4.1, gpt-5.1) each hit only ~2/6 — all missed a gross missing-sherpa
# defect and mis-read fine logo art. Default is anthropic; fail-closed without its key so
# a paid batch never runs on the unreliable judge or, worse, silently un-judged.
