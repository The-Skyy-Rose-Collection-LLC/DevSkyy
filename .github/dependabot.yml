# Dependabot Configuration Notes:
#
# Security Updates:
# - Dependabot automatically creates PRs for security vulnerabilities
# - These are created even if open-pull-requests-limit is reached
# - Security PRs have high priority and should be reviewed immediately
#
# Version Updates:
# - Weekly schedule checks for new versions every Monday at 3 AM UTC
# - Groups related packages together to reduce PR noise
# - Maximum 10 Python PRs, 5 GitHub Actions PRs, 3 Docker PRs at a time
#
# Review Process:
# - All PRs are automatically assigned to the DevSkyy team
# - Labels are applied for easy filtering
# - Commit messages follow conventional commit format
#
# Truth Protocol Alignment:
# - Ensures dependencies stay current with security patches
# - Automated testing via CI/CD validates updates before merge
# - Reduces manual dependency management burden
# - Maintains "Pin versions" and "No secrets in code" principles
