"""Sample SkyyRose product catalog for the Agent SDK starter.

IMPORTANT — this is DEMO data, decoupled on purpose.
The canonical SkyyRose catalog is `skyyrose-catalog.csv` (the project's source of truth).
This module hard-codes a tiny, self-contained sample so the starter runs anywhere without
the SOT files. When you wire this agent to the real store, replace `PRODUCTS` with a loader
that reads the canonical CSV / WooCommerce REST instead of editing these literals.

Each product is an immutable record (a frozen dataclass). Lookups return new lists; nothing
here mutates the catalog in place.
