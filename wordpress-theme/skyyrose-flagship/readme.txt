== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is WooCommerce required? =

Yes. WooCommerce is required for the product pages, cart, and checkout functionality. The theme is built around WooCommerce integration.

= Does the theme work without JavaScript? =

Core content and navigation are accessible without JavaScript. Enhanced features like the luxury cursor, cinematic mode, particle animations, and AJAX form submissions require JavaScript.

= Can I customize the brand colors? =

Yes. The WordPress Customizer includes settings for brand colors, social media URLs, and the site logo. The dark luxury palette (#0A0A0A backgrounds, rose gold accents) can be adjusted to match your brand.

= Is the theme accessible? =

Yes. The theme targets WCAG 2.2 AA compliance with semantic HTML, ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, focus indicators, and full prefers-reduced-motion support for users who disable animations.

= What about the luxury cursor on mobile? =

The luxury cursor (rose gold ring with sparkle trail) is desktop-only. It is automatically disabled on touch devices.

= How does conditional asset loading work? =

Each page template only loads the CSS and JavaScript it needs. Collection pages load particle animation scripts, immersive pages load scene scripts, and WooCommerce pages load cart/checkout scripts. This reduces page weight across the site.
