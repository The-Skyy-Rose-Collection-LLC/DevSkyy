Subject: Request CSP Domain Whitelist for Business Plan Site

Site: https://skyyrose.co
Plan: Business
Username: skyyroseco

Issue:
Platform-level Content Security Policy is blocking essential CDNs required for our luxury fashion e-commerce theme, causing 109 console errors on every page load.

Required CSP Domains:
- script-src: cdn.babylonjs.com, cdn.elementor.com, cdnjs.cloudflare.com, stats.wp.com, widgets.wp.com, s0.wp.com
- style-src: fonts-api.wp.com, s0.wp.com, cdn.elementor.com
- font-src: fonts-api.wp.com

Business Impact:
- 3D product viewer (core luxury feature) completely non-functional
- Elementor page builder broken
- WordPress.com's own domains blocked (stats.wp.com, widgets.wp.com, fonts-api.wp.com)
- Poor user experience, potential revenue loss

Technical Details:
Current CSP blocks these domains at platform level. We've confirmed header() calls, custom-redirects.php, and filters cannot override this. Request platform team add these domains to CSP whitelist for skyyrose.co.

Evidence:
curl -sI https://skyyrose.co/ shows platform CSP lacking these domains.

Request:
Please escalate to platform engineering to add domains to CSP or provide alternative solution.

Thank you!
