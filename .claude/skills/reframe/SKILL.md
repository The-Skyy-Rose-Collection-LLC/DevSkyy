When the user asks to change, pick, migrate, or "reframe" their project's UI framework:

1. Read `.wolf/reframe-frameworks.md` for the full framework knowledge base.
2. Ask the user the decision questions from the file (current stack, priority, Tailwind usage, theme preference, app type). Stop early once the choice narrows to 1-2 options.
3. Present a recommendation with reasoning based on the comparison matrix.
4. Once the user confirms, use the selected framework's prompt from the file — **adapted to the actual project** using `.wolf/anatomy.md` for real file paths, routes, and components.
5. Execute the migration: install dependencies, update config, refactor components.
6. After migration, run `openwolf designqc` to verify the new look.

**Do NOT read the entire reframe-frameworks.md into context upfront.** Read the decision questions and comparison matrix first (~50 lines). Only read the specific framework's prompt section after the user chooses.
