# Immediate Requirements - READ THIS FIRST

## User's Actual Requirements

1. **Backend + Frontend Dashboards**: ✅ DONE (localhost:8000 + localhost:3001)

2. **Product Asset Processing**:
   - Process ALL product photos from Desktop folders (not just 16 - should be way more)
   - SIGNATURE Collection: `/Users/coreyfoster/Desktop/_Signature Collection_/` (36+ files)
   - BLACK ROSE Collection: `/Users/coreyfoster/Desktop/BLACK Rose Collection.zip` (needs extraction)
   - Additional products: `/Users/coreyfoster/Desktop/Signature Collection.zip` (needs extraction)

3. **Asset Output**:
   - ALL products → 2D/2.5D visualizations (NO 3D for now)
   - Advanced 2D/2.5D like modern e-commerce sites

4. **WordPress Integration**:
   - Upload all enhanced + 2D/2.5D assets to WordPress
   - Attach to WooCommerce products
   - Get <https://skyyrose.com> FULLY FUNCTIONAL

5. **HuggingFace Spaces**:
   - Deploy remaining spaces (3d-converter, lora-training-monitor, virtual-tryon)
   - Embed spaces in WordPress /experiences/ pages

6. **CRITICAL - MUST USE**:
   - Context7 plugin (for library documentation lookups)
   - Serena plugin (for codebase navigation and editing)

## What I Did Wrong

1. ❌ Only processed 16 products instead of ALL products
2. ❌ Tried to generate 3D models (user said 2D/2.5D only for now)
3. ❌ Not using Context7 plugin
4. ❌ Not using Serena plugin
5. ❌ Tried to use HuggingFace Space API when it wasn't set up for enhancement

## Correct Next Steps

1. Extract ZIP files to get ALL products
2. Process ALL product photos (not hardcoded list - scan directories)
3. Create 2D/2.5D visualizations for ALL products
4. Upload to WordPress/WooCommerce
5. Use Context7 for any library questions
6. Use Serena for codebase work
