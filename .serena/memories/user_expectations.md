# User Expectations - CRITICAL

## Do Not

- Over-analyze or read files unnecessarily
- Produce placeholder content (boxes, spinners that don't stop)
- Waste time on research when user wants results
- Make multiple failed attempts

## Do

- Build working solutions FIRST TIME
- Deliver actual 3D clothing models, not geometric primitives
- Test before deploying
- Be direct and efficient

## User's Standards

- Expects production-quality output immediately
- Other LLMs have delivered working pages faster
- Time is valuable - no wasted iterations

## 3D Viewer Requirements

- Real clothing shapes (not boxes)
- OrbitControls for interaction
- Product selector sidebar
- SkyyRose brand colors (#B76E79)
- Works on first deploy
