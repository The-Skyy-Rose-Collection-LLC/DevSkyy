# LAYER 7 â€” SECURITY AND CONTAINMENT POLICY
# Fashion AI Bounded Autonomy System
# Version 1.0.0

====================================================================
SECURITY POLICY AND CONTAINMENT RULES
====================================================================

## 1. NETWORK ISOLATION

- DEFAULT: All outbound network calls are BLOCKED
- Exception: Requires explicit operator flag per operation
- All blocked attempts are logged to audit_log.csv
- Network calls tracked by: source agent, destination, timestamp

## 2. CREDENTIAL MANAGEMENT

- ALL credentials stored in .env file
- Encryption: AES-256-GCM
- Key derivation: PBKDF2 with 100,000 iterations
- NO credentials in code, logs, or configuration files
- Credentials rotated every 90 days (operator controlled)

## 3. PROCESS SANDBOXING

- Each agent runs in isolated process
- OS-level permissions enforced
- Resource limits:
  - CPU: 70% max per agent
  - Memory: 4GB max per agent
  - Disk I/O: 100MB/s max
- No cross-agent file system access

## 4. DATA ENCRYPTION

- At-rest encryption: AES-256-GCM
- In-transit encryption: TLS 1.3 minimum
- Key management: Local key store, encrypted
- Backup encryption: Same standards

## 5. AUDIT LOGGING

- ALL actions logged (no exceptions)
- Log format: Structured JSON
- Log retention: 365 days minimum
- Log integrity: SHA-256 hash chain
- Logs are append-only (no deletion/modification)

## 6. ACCESS CONTROL

- Role-based access control (RBAC)
- Roles:
  - OPERATOR: Full control
  - REVIEWER: Approval/rejection only
  - VIEWER: Read-only access
  - AGENT: Limited execution only
- All access logged with timestamp and action

## 7. APPROVAL WORKFLOWS

- Material changes require human approval
- Approval timeout: 24 hours (then expire)
- Multi-level approval for high-risk actions
- Emergency override: Requires OPERATOR role

## 8. CONTAINMENT RULES

- Agents CANNOT:
  - Modify their own code
  - Access other agents' memory
  - Make network calls (default)
  - Write outside designated paths
  - Execute arbitrary system commands
  - Access sensitive system files

- Agents CAN:
  - Read approved input files
  - Write to output directory
  - Execute approved functions only
  - Log to designated log files
  - Request operator approval

## 9. INCIDENT RESPONSE

On security violation:
1. IMMEDIATE: Halt offending agent
2. LOG: Complete stack trace and context
3. NOTIFY: Operator via notification queue
4. QUARANTINE: Move to isolated environment
5. REPORT: Generate incident report
6. AWAIT: Operator investigation

## 10. EMERGENCY CONTROLS

Emergency Stop:
- Accessible via CLI: emergency_stop <reason>
- Halts ALL agents immediately
- Preserves state for recovery
- Requires operator restart approval

System Pause:
- Accessible via CLI: pause_system
- Queues new operations
- Completes running operations
- Resume via CLI: resume_system

## 11. SECURE COMMUNICATION

Inter-agent messages:
- Encrypted: AES-256-GCM
- Authenticated: HMAC-SHA256
- Stored in local SQLite queue
- TTL: 1 hour
- No external message brokers

## 12. CODE INTEGRITY

- Agents cannot modify code
- Configuration changes require approval
- Version control for all changes
- Hash verification on startup
- Rollback capability maintained

## 13. DATA PROTECTION

- PII handling:
  - Encrypted at rest
  - Masked in logs
  - Access logged
  - Retention policy enforced

- Data validation:
  - Schema enforcement
  - Type checking
  - Range validation
  - Sanitization required

## 14. MONITORING AND ALERTS

- Real-time monitoring: Enabled
- Anomaly detection: Statistical + ML
- Alert thresholds:
  - Error rate > 5%: WARNING
  - Error rate > 10%: CRITICAL
  - Unusual behavior: ALERT

## 15. COMPLIANCE

- GDPR: Data export, deletion, retention
- SOC2: Audit logging, access control
- PCI-DSS: Encryption, secure storage
- Regular security audits: Quarterly

====================================================================
ENFORCEMENT
====================================================================

Violations of this policy result in:
1. Immediate agent halt
2. Incident report creation
3. Operator notification
4. Investigation requirement
5. Manual restart only

All policy changes require operator approval and version control.
