# Contributing to DevSkyy

Thank you for your interest in contributing to DevSkyy! This document provides guidelines and information for contributors.

## 🎯 Overview

DevSkyy is a luxury fashion AI platform with a multi-AI orchestration system. We welcome contributions that enhance the platform's capabilities, improve code quality, or expand documentation.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Python 3.11 or higher
- Git
- Docker (optional, for containerized development)

### Development Setup

1. **Clone the repository**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/SkyyRoseLLC/DevSkyy.git
   cd DevSkyy
   ```

2. **Install development dependencies**
   ```bash
   make dev-install
   ```

3. **Run tests to verify setup**
   ```bash
   make test
   ```

4. **Start the development server**
   ```bash
   make run
   ```

## 📋 Development Workflow

### Code Quality Standards

We maintain high code quality standards inspired by the SkyyRoseLLC/transformers repository:

- **Line Length**: 119 characters (professional standard)
- **Formatting**: Ruff (primary), Black (backup)
- **Linting**: Ruff with comprehensive rules
- **Type Checking**: MyPy for type safety
- **Testing**: Pytest with 90%+ coverage requirement

### Pre-commit Checks

Before committing, run:
```bash
make pre-commit
```

This will:
- Format code with Ruff
- Fix linting issues automatically
- Run fast tests
- Ensure code quality standards

### Full Quality Check

For comprehensive validation:
```bash
make check
```

This runs:
- Code quality checks (linting, formatting, type checking)
- Full test suite with coverage
- Security checks (bandit, safety, pip-audit)

## 🧪 Testing Guidelines

### Test Categories

We use pytest markers to organize tests:

- `@pytest.mark.unit` - Unit tests
- `@pytest.mark.integration` - Integration tests
- `@pytest.mark.api` - API endpoint tests
- `@pytest.mark.security` - Security-related tests
- `@pytest.mark.performance` - Performance tests
- `@pytest.mark.slow` - Long-running tests

### Running Specific Tests

```bash
# Unit tests only
make test-unit

# API tests only
make test-api

# Security tests only
make test-security

# Fast tests (excluding slow)
make test-fast

# With coverage report
make test-coverage
```

### Writing Tests

- Place tests in the `tests/` directory
- Mirror the source structure in test organization
- Use descriptive test names
- Include docstrings for complex test scenarios
- Mock external dependencies
- Aim for 90%+ code coverage

## 🔒 Security Guidelines

### Security Requirements

- All API endpoints must have authentication
- Input validation using Pydantic models
- No sensitive data in logs or error messages
- Regular security dependency updates

### Security Testing

```bash
# Run security checks
make security

# Generate security report
bandit -r agent api security infrastructure ml ai_orchestration -f html -o security-report.html
```

## 📝 Documentation Standards

### Code Documentation

- Use clear, descriptive docstrings
- Follow Google-style docstring format
- Include type hints for all functions
- Document complex business logic

### API Documentation

- All endpoints must have comprehensive docstrings
- Include request/response examples
- Document authentication requirements
- Specify error conditions

### Example Docstring

```python
async def create_partnership(
    partnership_data: PartnershipCreate,
    current_user: User = Depends(get_current_user)
) -> Partnership:
    """Create a new partnership in the orchestration system.
    
    Args:
        partnership_data: Partnership creation data including name, type, and configuration
        current_user: Authenticated user making the request
        
    Returns:
        Partnership: Created partnership object with generated ID and metadata
        
    Raises:
        HTTPException: 400 if partnership data is invalid
        HTTPException: 403 if user lacks permission
        HTTPException: 409 if partnership already exists
        
    Example:
        ```python
        partnership = await create_partnership(
            PartnershipCreate(name="AI Assistant", type="technical"),
            current_user
        )
        ```
    """
```
