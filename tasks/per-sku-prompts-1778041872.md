### Front
- **front-chest** (~10in tall × proportional width): The Black Rose logo,
  **physically embossed/debossed into the fabric surface** as a tonal raised
  relief. The full art (three roses + stems + thorny vines + cloud) is impressed
  into the fabric — viewer sees the *shapes* in 3D relief but the colors are

  white cloud — all tonal black-on-black). Subtle 3D texture visible only in
  directional/raking light. **Technique:** embossed. **Color:** tonal black-on-black.

  collar): The SR monogram (gold metallic art — see sr-monogram reference).
  Embroidered directly onto the jersey in gold-tone thread. **Technique:**
  embroidered. **Color:** gold-tone thread (preserves the gold-to-copper
  gradient from the canonical mark).

  the black body. **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** white.

Study the reference image carefully. This is a relaxed n/a called "BLACK Rose Crewneck".

Your job: generate a photorealistic e-commerce product photo showing ONLY the front of this garment.

The garment is Smooth, lustrous knit fabric with a satin-like sheen for the body and sleeves. The collar, cuffs, and hem are made of a matte, ribbed knit.. It has EXACTLY 1 graphic element(s):
  #1 "A detailed graphic featuring two stylized roses with leaves, emerging from a cloud or smoke-like base. The roses are depicted in shades of dark grey, mid-grey, and light grey with white highlights. The leaves are a muted greenish-grey. The base is composed of various shades of grey and white."
      WHERE: front chest center — LOCKED POSITION, do not move
      SIZE: approximately 9" H x 6" W — LOCKED SIZE, do not enlarge or shrink
      TECHNIQUE: embroidery
      FINISH: 3D dimensional, raised, textured embroidery
      COLORS: #222222, #666666, #AAAAAA, #FFFFFF, #708070, #555555, #BBBBBB

These graphics are LOCKED — same size, same position, same colors as the reference. Do not move, resize, or duplicate them.

Color spec:
  body: #000000 (satin)
  sleeves: #000000 (satin)
  trim: #FFFFFF (matte)

Construction:
  panels: Standard set-in sleeves with a single-panel body construction.
  seams: Standard flatlock seams, tonal stitching throughout.
  closures: None (pullover style).
  details: Ribbed crewneck collar, ribbed cuffs, and ribbed hem band. All ribbed sections are in a contrasting white color.

Render the garment floating on an invisible form (no model, no mannequin) with:
- Deep matte black (#0A0A0A) backdrop with subtle charcoal gradient
- Cool silver key light from upper-left, black fill, thin silver rim light creating metallic edge highlights
- Photorealistic fabric texture with natural 3D drape and shadow

CRITICAL NEGATIVE RULES:
  - This garment has EXACTLY 1 graphic element(s)
  - ONE graphic only — do NOT add a second logo, patch, or mark anywhere
  - Do NOT change sizes — if spec says 4.5 inches, render 4.5 inches
  - Do NOT move positions — if spec says left chest, it stays left chest
  - Do NOT invent pockets, stripes, panels, or details not in the reference
  - Do NOT add team names, athlete names, sponsor logos, or league marks
  - FRONT VIEW ONLY — do not show the back
  - Match the reference EXACTLY — this is luxury fashion, accuracy is everything

DO NOT RENDER (authored canonical negatives):
- NO printed graphics anywhere — not on chest, not on back, not on sleeves, not on hem.
- NO printed text — no "BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL" arched text, no other printed words.
- NO full-color rendering of the rose logo on the front chest — the front-chest
  logo is tonal embossed only. NO kelly-green stems visible. NO white-and-blue
  cloud color visible. NO greyscale rose petals visible. The embossing flattens
  all colors to the base fabric color.
- NO embroidered Black Rose logo on the front chest (the front is embossed,
  NOT embroidered — embroidery would render visible thread color).
- NO embroidered patches on the lower right front (this is NOT a baseball jersey).
- NO SR monogram on the front chest. NO SR monogram on the sleeves. NO SR
  monogram at the back-center. The SR monogram is at the back-neck only.
- NO embroidered roses on mid back (the back-CENTER is empty; the SR monogram
  sits at the back-neck only).
- NO baseball player graphics anywhere.
- NO sleeve patches, sleeve embroidery, sleeve printing — sleeves are clean.
- NO hem or side-seam decoration on the body fabric — the hem is plain ribbed
  knit (white), no logo, no text, no piping.
- NO chest text other than the embossed rose logo.
- NO contrasting-color logos on the body fabric beyond the back-neck SR monogram.
- NO silicone appliqué.
- NO heat-transfer vinyl.
- NO sublimated panels.
- NO black ribbed neckband (the rib trim is WHITE, not tonal black).

  embroidered SR monogram, distinct from the front silicone patch.)
- NO Black Rose silicone patch on the back — the back's only branding is
  the small gold SR monogram on the back-right hip.

NO player name on back. NO pinstripes. NOT a t-shirt. NOT a hoodie. NOT a basketball jersey. NOT a football jersey. Mid-weight knit jersey fabric. Solid black colorway (this is the Classic base; Oakland / Giants / White editions are separate SKUs br-003-oakland / br-003-giants / br-003-white).

BRANDING — exactly what to render:
> Logo art for "Black Rose logo" entries below is the canonical
> three-rose-cluster art at `data/brand-logos/black-rose-logo.md`.
> The "Authentic Collection patch" graphic is at
> `data/brand-logos/black-rose-authentic-collection-patch.md`.
> The "SR monogram" is the gold lettermark at
> `data/brand-logos/sr-monogram.md`.
> A reference techflat for the assembled product (front + back) is at
> `data/product-references/br-003-baseball-classic-techflat.jpeg`.

### Front
- **front-chest** (large, arched, ~9in wide): The phrase **"BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL"**
  as authentic tackle-twill lettering — pre-cut white fabric letters appliquéd
  onto the black jersey body in a baseball-script style with a subtle classic
  outline, arched across the upper-front-chest. **Technique:** tackle-twill.
  **Color:** white twill letters (no contrast satin-stitch edge — clean
  white-on-black).
- **front-left-hem / front-belly-lower-left** (~2in × 2.5in, near the bottom
  hem on the wearer's left hip): The Black Rose Authentic Collection patch —
  the rectangular yellow-and-white multi-element patch defined in the patch
  reference file (BLACK ROSE / MLB-style batter silhouette / AUTHENTIC banner /
  COLLECTION / red diamond divider / Members Only Yay Area Ca / SkyyRose
  Collection script / Made for Kings ang Queens). **Technique:**
  embroidered-patch (woven full-color patch sewn onto the jersey).

### Back
- **back-neck** (small, ~2in wide, top-center just below the collar yoke):
  The **SR monogram** (gold metallic art — see sr-monogram reference).

  embroidered. **Color:** gold-tone thread (preserves the gold-to-copper
  gradient from the canonical mark; NOT flat yellow, NOT silver).
- **back-center** (large, ~10in–12in tall, vertically centered between the
  yoke and the lower hem): The Black Rose logo (the canonical three-rose
  cluster on cloud — see logo_reference). Embroidered directly onto the jersey
  in **white thread on the black fabric**. The composition's shapes (three
  roses, stems, thorny vines, cloud) are preserved via the original art's
  outlines and inner detail; the multi-color palette is NOT preserved — this
  is a single-color white-thread embroidery rendering the silhouette and
  shape detail in white. **Technique:** embroidered. **Color:** white thread
  on black fabric.

### Sleeves / Collar / Hem / Other

  button hardware). **Color:** white.

  the inside back of the collar. **Technique:** woven-label. **Color:**

  orange thread.
- **back-center** (~10in–12in tall): The Black Rose logo embroidered directly

    "A") + gold satin-stitch edge.
- **front-left-hem / front-belly-lower-left** (~2in × 2.5in): The Black Rose
  Authentic Collection patch (full multi-color: yellow field, navy text,
  white banner, red diamond divider, etc. — see patch reference). Sewn onto
  the lower-left hip. **Technique:** embroidered-patch.

### Back
- **back-neck** (small, ~2in wide): The SR monogram, embroidered directly
  onto the jersey in **gold-tone thread** (matching the colorway theme — the
  SR mark renders in gold to match the gold satin-stitch edge and the gold
  piping). **Technique:** embroidered. **Color:** gold-tone thread.
- **back-center** (~10in–12in tall): The Black Rose logo embroidered directly
  onto the jersey. The roses, stems, and thorny vines are rendered in
  **white thread**; the cloud at the base of the cluster is rendered in
  **yellow/gold thread** (a colorway-specific accent — the cloud picks up
  the Oakland yellow palette while the rose-cluster stays white-thread).
  **Technique:** embroidered. **Color:** white thread on the rose-cluster +
  yellow/gold thread on the cloud at the base.

### Sleeves / Collar / Hem / Other
- **collar / V-neck binding**: Gold/yellow contrast piping/binding around the
  V-neck collar opening (1/4in–3/8in wide). **Technique:** stitched.
  **Color:** gold/yellow.
- **left-cuff / right-cuff binding**: Gold/yellow piping around both sleeve
  cuff openings. **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** gold/yellow.
- **front-placket binding**: Gold/yellow piping running vertically down both
  sides of the front button placket. **Technique:** stitched. **Color:**
  gold/yellow.
- **front-placket buttons** (~5–6 buttons, evenly spaced down the placket).
  **Technique:** patch (sewn-on hardware). **Color:** body-matching
  (green/yellow tone — blends with the placket).
- **collar-inside** (~1.75in × 0.75in): Woven brand label sewn into the
  inside back of the collar. **Technique:** woven-label.

Study the reference image carefully. This is a  called "BLACK is Beautiful Jersey Series: 0. Baseball Classic (Oakland Edition)".

Your job: generate a photorealistic e-commerce product photo showing ONLY the front of this garment.

The garment is . It has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s):
  NONE — this is a plain garment

These graphics are LOCKED — same size, same position, same colors as the reference. Do not move, resize, or duplicate them.

Color spec:
  Solid black (#000000)

Construction:


Render the garment floating on an invisible form (no model, no mannequin) with:
- Deep matte black (#0A0A0A) backdrop with subtle charcoal gradient
- Cool silver key light from upper-left, black fill, thin silver rim light creating metallic edge highlights
- Photorealistic fabric texture with natural 3D drape and shadow

CRITICAL NEGATIVE RULES:
  - This garment has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s)
  - NO logos, NO text, NO patches, NO embroidery — completely blank
  - Do NOT change sizes — if spec says 4.5 inches, render 4.5 inches
  - Do NOT move positions — if spec says left chest, it stays left chest
  - Do NOT invent pockets, stripes, panels, or details not in the reference
  - Do NOT add team names, athlete names, sponsor logos, or league marks
  - FRONT VIEW ONLY — do not show the back
  - Match the reference EXACTLY — this is luxury fashion, accuracy is everything

DO NOT RENDER (authored canonical negatives):
- NO player number, NO player name on front, back, or sleeves.
- NO white piping (this colorway uses GOLD/YELLOW piping — not white).
- NO orange piping (that's the Giants colorway).
- NO black piping (that's the White edition).
- NO solid-yellow tackle-twill letters — letter FACES are WHITE (with one
  black "A"); only the satin-stitch EDGE is gold.
- NO uniform letter color — the "A" in "BLACK" is BLACK while every other
  letter is white. This is the colorway's signature detail.
- NO contrast satin edge OTHER than gold (no white edge, no red edge).
- NO gold thread on the rose-cluster — only the cloud is yellow/gold thread;
  the roses and stems are WHITE thread.
- NO multi-color rendering of the rose-cluster (kelly-green stems, etc.) —
  the cluster is white thread; the cloud is the only colorway accent in gold.
- NO orange or red anywhere on this colorway.
- NO Black Rose logo on the chest — the chest carries only the tackle-twill
  wordmark and the lower-left Authentic Collection patch.
- NO SR monogram on the back-center — that region is the rose-cluster only.
- NO sleeve patches anywhere on this jersey.
- NO pinstripes, NO embossed/debossed, NO sublimated panels, NO heat-transfer
  vinyl, NO printed graphics on the body.

CANONICAL DESIGN SPEC (authored truth — overrides any conflicting inferred description below):

GARMENT TYPE (must match exactly):
Authentic-style baseball jersey — V-neck collar opening, button-front placket, short sleeves, straight even hem (no drop-tail). Solid **white** base fabric with **black** piping/binding around V-neck collar, sleeve cuffs, and down both sides of the front placket. Black buttons on the placket. NO player number on front or back. NO player name on back. NO pinstripes. Mid-weight knit jersey. This is the WHITE colorway (separate SKU from Classic black br-003 / Giants br-003-giants / Oakland br-003-oakland).

BRANDING — exactly what to render:
> Logo art canonical references:
> - Black Rose three-rose-cluster: `data/brand-logos/black-rose-logo.md`
> - Authentic Collection patch:    `data/brand-logos/black-rose-authentic-collection-patch.md`
> - SR monogram:                   `data/brand-logos/sr-monogram.md`
> - Product techflat:              `data/product-references/br-003-white-techflat.jpeg`

### Front
- **front-chest** (large, arched, ~9in wide): The phrase **"BLACK IS BEAUTIFUL"**
  as authentic tackle-twill lettering — pre-cut **black** fabric letters
  appliquéd onto the white jersey body in a baseball-script style, arched
  across the upper-front-chest. **Technique:** tackle-twill. **Color:** black
  twill letters (the inverse colorway treatment of the Classic black; clean
  black-on-white with no contrast satin-stitch edge).
- **front-left-hem / front-belly-lower-left** (~2in × 2.5in): The Black Rose
  Authentic Collection patch (full multi-color — yellow field, navy text,
  white banner, red diamond divider, etc.). Sewn onto the lower-left hip.
  **Technique:** embroidered-patch.

### Back
- **back-neck** (small, ~2in wide): The SR monogram, embroidered directly
  onto the jersey in **black or dark-tone thread** (the gold-on-white would
  read poorly; the colorway uses black thread to maintain the high-contrast
  reading). **Technique:** embroidered. **Color:** black thread.
- **back-center** (~10in–12in tall): The Black Rose logo embroidered directly
  onto the jersey in **black thread on the white fabric** (the inverse
  treatment of the Classic black colorway's white-on-black). The composition's
  shapes (three roses, stems, thorny vines, cloud) are preserved via the
  original art's outlines and inner shading; on white background, the
  embroidered art may show greyscale shading more naturally — petals can
  carry darker fills, cloud renders lighter (grey-thread or stitch-density
  variation). **Technique:** embroidered. **Color:** primarily black thread
  with optional grey-thread shading on the cloud and lighter rose details.

### Sleeves / Collar / Hem / Other
- **collar / V-neck binding**: Black contrast piping/binding around the
  V-neck collar opening (1/4in–3/8in wide). **Technique:** stitched.
  **Color:** black.
- **left-cuff / right-cuff binding**: Black piping around both sleeve cuff
  openings. **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** black.
- **front-placket binding**: Black piping running vertically down both sides
  of the front button placket. **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** black.
- **front-placket buttons** (~5–6 buttons, plain BLACK or dark-tone, evenly
  spaced). **Technique:** patch (sewn-on hardware). **Color:** black.
- **collar-inside** (~1.75in × 0.75in): Woven brand label sewn into the
  inside back of the collar. **Technique:** woven-label.

CANONICAL DESIGN SPEC (authored truth — overrides any conflicting inferred description below):

GARMENT TYPE (must match exactly):
Black pullover hoodie — long sleeves, drawstring hood, kangaroo front pocket, ribbed cuffs at the wrists, ribbed waist hem at the bottom (all tonal black, no contrast white trim — distinct from the matching Black Rose Crewneck/Joggers set which use white ribbing). NOT a zip-up. NOT a half-zip. NOT a crewneck. NOT a t-shirt. Heavyweight cotton fleece.

BRANDING — exactly what to render:
> Logo art canonical reference:
> - Black Rose three-rose-cluster: `data/brand-logos/black-rose-logo.md`
> - Reference photo:                `data/product-references/br-004-hoodie-real-front.jpeg`

### Front
- **front-chest** (~5–6in tall, centered just above the kangaroo pocket):
  The Black Rose logo embroidered onto the hoodie. **Technique:**
  embroidered. **Color:** as rendered in the canonical logo + reference
  image (do NOT over-specify thread colorway in this dossier — the RAS
  pipeline reads the canonical logo art and the product reference photo
  for the thread treatment).

### Back
- (No decoration. Completely clean back. NO SR monogram on back-neck. NO
  rose on back-center. NO logos anywhere on the back.)

### Sleeves / Collar / Hem / Other
- **left-sleeve** (upper / shoulder area, exact dimensions TBD): A small
  patch is visible in the reference photo at the upper-left-sleeve area.
  Patch content, technique, and dimensions are **PARKED for later
  verification** — Corey will confirm the patch detail in a follow-up
  read-back. **Do not render this region with guessed content** —
  the RAS pipeline should treat the upper-left-sleeve area as "small patch
  present, content unverified" and prompt for the verification before
  rendering this region in production.
- **right-sleeve**: clean, no decoration.
- **kangaroo-pocket** (front): clean, no embroidery, no logo, no
  decoration on the pocket itself.
- **hood-drawstring**: tonal black flat drawstring (matches the body —
  NOT contrast-color white, NOT contrast-color rose-gold). Plain tips,
  no metal, no branded tip.
- **collar-inside / interior-back-collar** (~1.75in × 0.75in): Branded
  woven size tag (universal SkyyRose product rule — every product carries
  a branded woven size tag at this position). Shows the SKU's size
  designation. **Technique:** woven-label. **Color:** brand-standard
  (typically black with brand-color accents and white/printed size text).

DO NOT RENDER (authored canonical negatives):
- NO rose on the back. NO SR monogram on the back. The back is COMPLETELY
  clean black fabric.
- NO white ribbed trim on cuffs, hem, or hood — the Black Rose Hoodie
  uses TONAL BLACK ribbing throughout (the white ribbing is the
  Crewneck/Joggers signature, not the Hoodie).
- NO contrast-color drawstrings — they are tonal black, not white,
  not rose-gold, not gold.
- NO Black Rose logo on the back. NO Black Rose logo on the sleeves. NO
  Black Rose logo on the kangaroo pocket. The rose appears at the
  front-chest only.

- NO embossed/debossed decoration on the body or hood.
- NO printed graphics, NO sublimated panels, NO heat-transfer vinyl,
  NO puff-print decoration.

- NO contrasting hood lining (assume same black tonal — to be verified
  if a contrast lining exists, but default is uniform black).
- NO chest text or wordmark (the front rose is the only chest decoration).
- NO Authentic Collection patch (that patch is reserved for the jersey
  series, not the hoodie).

### Final prompt sent to generator

```
CANONICAL DESIGN SPEC (authored truth — overrides any conflicting inferred description below):

GARMENT TYPE (must match exactly):
Black PULLOVER hoodie — long sleeves, drawstring hood, kangaroo front pocket, ribbed cuffs at the wrists, ribbed waist hem at the bottom (tonal black ribbing, no contrast white trim). Constructed from a **lightweight polyester / jogger-feel fabric** (NOT heavyweight cotton fleece — distinct from the basic Black Rose Hoodie br-004 which is heavier cotton). NOT a zip-up. NOT a half-zip. NOT a crewneck. The "Signature Edition" identity comes from the elevated branding placement (chest + hip), the white drawstrings, and the sublimated-rose-print inner hood lining.

BRANDING — exactly what to render:
> Logo art canonical reference:
> - Black Rose three-rose-cluster: `data/brand-logos/black-rose-logo.md`
> - Reference photo:                `data/product-references/br-005-signature-hoodie-real.jpeg`

### Front
- **front-right-chest** (small, ~2–3in tall): The Black Rose logo as a
  **silicone cut-out patch** — silicone applied to the fabric in the
  shape of the canonical three-rose-cluster art (cut-out silicone shape
  rather than full-color silicone-appliqué). Tonal/monochrome treatment
  per the reference photo. **Technique:** silicone. **Color:** as rendered
  in the canonical logo + reference image (white/grey tonal).

### Back
- (No back-neck SR monogram, no back-center logo confirmed in this read-back —
  back details to be verified if Corey provides a back reference photo. Default:
  treat the back as clean unless confirmed otherwise.)

### Sleeves / Collar / Hem / Other
- **left-hip / left-side-body** (large, ~6–7in tall, on the wearer's
  LEFT side at the hip / lower-side-body area, NOT on the sleeve): The
  Black Rose logo embroidered onto the side of the hoodie body. Position
  is explicitly the side body at hip level — Corey emphasized "NOT
  SLEEVE." **Technique:** embroidered. **Color:** as rendered in the
  canonical logo + reference image.
- **hood-inside / inner-hood-lining**: GREY contrast lining inside the
  hood with the **Black Rose logo sublimated throughout** as a repeating /
  scattered pattern (the canonical three-rose-cluster art appears
  multiple times across the lining fabric, faded/tonal style consistent
  with sublimation dye). Visible only when the hood is laid open or worn
  down. **Technique:** sublimated. **Color:** light tonal print on grey
  lining fabric.
- **hood-drawstring**: WHITE flat drawstring threaded through the hood
  (contrast against the black body fabric). Plain tips, no metal,
  no branded tip. **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** white.
- **kangaroo-pocket** (front): clean, no embroidery, no logo on the
  pocket fabric.
- **collar-inside / interior-back-collar** (~1.75in × 0.75in): Branded
  woven size tag (universal SkyyRose product rule). **Technique:**
  woven-label.

DO NOT RENDER (authored canonical negatives):

  position only.
- NO embroidered logo on either sleeve. Corey's explicit instruction:
  the side-body logo is NOT on the sleeve, it is on the BODY at the
  side-hip area.
- NO Black Rose logo on the right hip — the embroidered side-body logo
  is on the LEFT side at the hip, not the right.
- NO black drawstrings — the drawstrings are WHITE (signature detail of
  this edition).
- NO silicone-appliqué multi-color patch — the right-chest silicone is
  a tonal cut-out, not a full multi-color appliqué.
- NO printed graphics on the body fabric (the rose-pattern sublimation
  is on the INNER HOOD LINING only, not on the body fabric, sleeves, or
  pocket).
- NO sublimated Black Rose pattern on the body, sleeves, or pocket —
  only the inner hood lining carries the sublimated rose pattern.
- NO contrasting hem or cuff trim — the rib trim is tonal black on this
  edition.

  Joggers signature details, not the Signature Hoodie).
- NO Authentic Collection patch (that patch is reserved for the jersey
  series).
- NO embossed/debossed decoration on the body or hood fabric.
- NO chest text or wordmark on the front body fabric — branding is the
  silicone right-chest mark + the embroidered left-side body mark only.
- NO heavyweight cotton fleece texture — this hoodie is the lighter
  polyester / jogger-feel variant (distinct from br-004's cotton fleece).

Hooded (sherpa-lined hood). **Front closure is a ZIPPER underneath with a button-overlap storm-flap covering it** — the zipper runs the full center-front length, and a buttoned/snapped storm flap overlaps the zipper line for a clean satin front (this is a two-layer placket). **Side hand pockets with zipper closures** at the lower sides. Long sleeves with **black ribbed cuffs**. **Black ribbed bomber-style waistband** at the bottom hem. NOT a parka. NOT a denim jacket. NOT a fleece hoodie. NOT a windbreaker. NOT a leather jacket.

### Front
- **front-left-chest** (small, ~3–4in tall): The Black Rose logo embroidered
  directly onto the satin. The full canonical art (three-rose cluster on
  cloud) is rendered in white-thread embroidery on the black satin fabric.
  **Technique:** embroidered. **Color:** as rendered in the canonical logo +
  reference image (white-thread silhouette preserving the canonical art's
  shape detail).

### Back
- **back-center** (~10in tall): The Black Rose logo embroidered directly
  onto the back of the jacket, centered on the back panel. Significantly
  larger than the front-left-chest mark — this is the signature

  rendered in the canonical logo + reference image.

### Sleeves / Collar / Hem / Other
- **front-placket-zipper** (full center-front length): Black zipper

  **Color:** black zipper teeth.
- **front-placket-storm-flap** (covering the zipper line): A black
  satin storm flap overlaps the zipper line, secured with **buttons /

  underneath the flap). **Technique:** patch (sewn-on snap/button
  hardware). **Color:** black snaps/buttons on black satin.
- **front-placket-drawstring**: A flat black drawstring threaded down
  the inside of the placket area, hanging visibly from inside the hood
  toward the chest. **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** black.

  pockets with **zipper closures** at the openings. **Technique:**
  patch (sewn-on hardware — zipper teeth). **Color:** black zipper teeth.

  (tonal black, contrasting with the satin sleeves). **Technique:**
  stitched. **Color:** black.

  bottom of the jacket. **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** black.

  hood (plush textured fabric, distinct from the satin exterior).
  **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** black sherpa.
- **body-inside / inner-body-lining**: Black sherpa lining inside the
  body of the jacket (visible when the front placket is open).
  **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** black sherpa.

  woven size tag (universal SkyyRose product rule). Visible as a small
  white-and-brand-color tag in the reference photos. **Technique:**

  a buttoned/snapped storm flap overlapping it (NOT a snap-only design;
  NOT a zipper-only exposed-teeth design — the zipper is hidden under
  the snap-buttoned satin storm flap).
- NO SR monogram on the back-neck — there is NO back-neck logo of any
  kind on this jacket (distinct from the crewneck / jerseys which carry
  a back-neck SR monogram).
- NO logos on the back-yoke or upper back — the rose is centered on
  the mid-back panel only.
- NO contrast-color piping on the sleeves, body, or hood.
- NO white drawstrings — the placket-area drawstring is BLACK.
- NO white ribbed trim at cuffs or waistband — they are tonal black.
- NO fleece, NO cotton-fleece body fabric — this jacket is black SATIN
  with a sherpa interior, NOT cotton fleece.
- NO hood without sherpa lining — the hood interior IS sherpa-lined.
- NO Black Rose logo on the back-neck region between the hood and the
  back panel — the back rose is at back-center (mid-back), not at the
  back-neck.
- NO multi-color rendering of either rose — the canonical art is
  rendered in white-thread embroidery on the black satin.
- NO Authentic Collection patch (that patch is reserved for the jersey series).
- NO embossed/debossed decoration anywhere.
- NO printed graphics, NO sublimated panels (the inner hood lining is
  PLAIN black sherpa for this jacket — distinct from br-005's grey
  sublimated-rose inner hood).

CANONICAL DESIGN SPEC (authored truth — overrides any conflicting inferred description below):

GARMENT TYPE (must match exactly):
Knee-length (or just-above-knee) athletic basketball shorts — black mesh main body with white mesh side panels, white elasticated waistband with white drawstring, **two side hand pockets** (left and right — both with zipper closures) and **one back pocket** (also with zipper closure) — three zip pockets total. Black ribbed-binding hem with white contrast piping. Cross-collection collab combining Black Rose and Love Hurts visual systems on a single garment. NOT pants. NOT joggers. NOT short-shorts. NOT a swim trunk. NOT a track short.

BRANDING — exactly what to render:
> Logo art canonical references:
> - Black Rose three-rose-cluster: `data/brand-logos/black-rose-logo.md`
> - Love Hurts (wordmark + broken-heart-and-thorns lockup): `data/brand-logos/love-hurts-logo.md`

> **Every logo on this product is converted to the shorts' tonal colorway
> — black, grey, white, and cream/peach.** The canonical reds (Love Hurts
> wordmark, red-roses-cluster), kelly-greens (stems), and white-and-blue

> garment. The cross-collection collab is signaled by *placement and

> - Side panels: white mesh
> - Sublimated patterns: tonal grey on black
> - Embroidered logos: tonal grey / cream / dark grey on white mesh
> - Tackle-twill: white face with dark satin-stitch edge
> - Wordmark colors: cream / peach / light-pink (NOT red)
> - Back-center pentagon panel logo: dark grey on white

### Front
- **front-body** (entire black mesh field): The Black Rose three-rose-cluster
  art **sublimated as a small repeating pattern across the entire black mesh
  body fabric** — small tonal grey rose silhouettes scattered across the
  mesh like an all-over print. Subtle (almost camo-like) on black ground,
  visible in close-up but reads as textured field at distance. **Technique:**
  sublimated. **Color:** tonal grey on black mesh.
- **front-thigh-center** (large, arched, ~6–7in wide): The wordmark
  **"OAKLAND"** as authentic tackle-twill — pre-cut white twill letters
  appliquéd onto the body in classic baseball-script style with a contrast
  satin-stitch edge. **Technique:** tackle-twill. **Color:** white twill
  letter face with a dark satin-stitch edge.
- **front-right-thigh** (cursive script overlapping the OAKLAND wordmark):
  The "Love Hurts" wordmark in cursive script, rendered as a large
  sublimated/printed wordmark in **cream/peach/pink tonal color** on the
  black mesh. Spans the right thigh area, reading top-to-bottom as the
  cursive lettering descends. **Technique:** sublimated. **Color:**
  cream/peach/light-pink tonal.
- **left-mesh-side-panel** (small, on the white mesh side panel):
  The Black Rose three-rose-cluster art (canonical *shape* — three roses,
  thorny vines, cloud at base) stitched onto the white mesh **in tonal
  grey / dark thread only** (NOT canonical multi-color — this product
  remaps every logo into the tonal grey/white/cream palette per the
  COLORWAY OVERRIDE above). The cluster is recognizable by composition
  but NOT by color. **Technique:** embroidered. **Color:** tonal
  grey/dark thread on white mesh (no kelly-green stems, no white-and-
  blue cloud).
- **right-mesh-side-panel** (small, on the white mesh side panel):
  The "Love Hurts" wordmark (cursive script only — no broken heart in
  this position) stitched onto the white mesh. **Technique:** embroidered.
  **Color:** dark/contrast thread on white mesh.

### Back
- **back-body** (entire black mesh field): Same sublimated tonal grey
  rose-cluster pattern as the front-body (continuous across the garment).
  **Technique:** sublimated. **Color:** tonal grey on black mesh.
- **back-upper / back-yoke** (large cursive across the upper back):
  The "Love Hurts" wordmark in cursive script, rendered larger than the
  front-right version, in **cream/peach/light-pink tonal color** sublimated
  onto the back mesh. **Technique:** sublimated. **Color:** cream/peach/
  light-pink tonal.
- **back-center-lower** (pentagon-shaped white panel insert, ~6–7in across):
  A **white pentagon-star-shaped contrast fabric panel** sewn into the
  lower-back-center between the two leg openings. Inside the panel:
  the Love Hurts full lockup (broken-heart-and-thorns + "Love Hurts"
  wordmark — see logo_reference) printed/embroidered in dark grey on
  the white panel. **Technique:** patch (pentagonal contrast fabric) +
  embroidered (Love Hurts logo on the panel). **Color:** white panel +
  dark grey logo art.

### Sleeves / Collar / Hem / Other
- **waistband-rib**: White elasticated waistband at the top.
  **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** white.
- **drawstring**: White flat drawstring threaded through the waistband.
  **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** white.
- **left-side-pocket / right-side-pocket** (front-side hand pockets):
  Vertical hand pockets at both sides, **with zipper closures**.
  **Technique:** patch (sewn-on zipper hardware). **Color:** black
  zipper teeth (with white piping at the pocket edge).
- **back-pocket** (single, centered upper-back, with zipper):
  One zippered back pocket — visible as a horizontal welt opening
  with white piping at the welt edges. **Technique:** patch (sewn-on
  zipper hardware). **Color:** black zipper teeth (with white piping
  at the welt edges).
- **hem / leg-binding**: Black ribbed-knit binding at the leg openings
  with a thin white contrast piping accent. **Technique:** stitched.
  **Color:** black with white piping.
- **inside-waistband** (~1in × 0.5in): Branded woven size tag (universal
  SkyyRose product rule). **Technique:** woven-label.

Study the reference image carefully. This is a  called "BLACK Rose x Love Hurts Basketball Shorts".

Your job: generate a photorealistic e-commerce product photo showing ONLY the front of this garment.

The garment is . It has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s):
  NONE — this is a plain garment

These graphics are LOCKED — same size, same position, same colors as the reference. Do not move, resize, or duplicate them.

Color spec:
  Solid black (#000000)

Construction:


Render the garment floating on an invisible form (no model, no mannequin) with:
- Deep matte black (#0A0A0A) backdrop with subtle charcoal gradient
- Cool silver key light from upper-left, black fill, thin silver rim light creating metallic edge highlights
- Photorealistic fabric texture with natural 3D drape and shadow

CRITICAL NEGATIVE RULES:
  - This garment has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s)
  - NO logos, NO text, NO patches, NO embroidery — completely blank
  - Do NOT change sizes — if spec says 4.5 inches, render 4.5 inches
  - Do NOT move positions — if spec says left chest, it stays left chest
  - Do NOT invent pockets, stripes, panels, or details not in the reference
  - Do NOT add team names, athlete names, sponsor logos, or league marks
  - FRONT VIEW ONLY — do not show the back
  - Match the reference EXACTLY — this is luxury fashion, accuracy is everything

DO NOT RENDER (authored canonical negatives):
- **NO canonical-color rendering of any logo on this garment.** Every
  logo on these shorts is converted to the shorts' tonal palette
  (black/grey/white/cream/peach). Specifically:
  - NO red roses anywhere — the body sublimation is the Black Rose
    three-rose-cluster in tonal grey-on-black, NOT the canonical
    multi-color or Love Hurts red-roses variant.
  - NO kelly-green stems on the left mesh side panel cluster — the
    embroidered cluster is rendered in tonal grey/dark thread only.
  - NO white-and-blue cloud color on any rose-cluster — clouds remap
    to plain white or tonal grey on this product.
  - NO bright red Love Hurts wordmark — the cursive script is rendered
    in cream/peach/light-pink tonal, NOT the canonical saturated red.
  - NO bright red broken-heart-and-thorns lockup on the back-center
    pentagon — the Love Hurts logo on the panel is rendered in dark
    grey on white, NOT in canonical red and brown vines.
- NO Black Rose three-rose-cluster on the right mesh side panel — the
  right side carries the Love Hurts wordmark only.
- NO Love Hurts wordmark on the left mesh side panel — the left side
  carries the Black Rose cluster only.
- NO multi-color rendering of the body sublimated rose pattern — it is
  tonal grey-on-black, NOT the full multi-color art.
- NO Black Rose logo at front-thigh-center — the front center carries
  the OAKLAND tackle-twill wordmark, not a rose.
- NO solid-color body — the body fabric carries the sublimated rose
  pattern (NOT a plain black field).
- NO front pockets visible from outside — the visible pockets are on
  the BACK only; the front is uninterrupted by pocket openings.
- NO black drawstrings — the drawstring is white.
- NO black waistband — the waistband is white.
- NO contrast satin-stitch edge other than dark on the OAKLAND letters.
- NO numbers anywhere — no player number, no jersey-style numerals.
- NO sleeve elements (this is a shorts garment, lower-body only — no
  upper-body decoration of any kind).
- NO Authentic Collection patch (that is reserved for the jersey series).
- NO sublimated pattern on the white mesh side panels — the side panels
  are clean white mesh with only the embroidered cluster (left) and
  wordmark (right) on top.

> The number-fill rose-cluster art is rendered in **tonal greyscale only**
> (black + white + grey shading + black ink outlines), NOT canonical
> multi-color. The cluster is recognizable by composition (three roses,

> stems, NO white-and-blue clouds.

### Front

  neckband and the lower belly): The number **"80"** rendered as

  **Color:** black twill letters on red ground (no contrast satin-stitch edge).
- **back-center** (large, ~12in tall, vertically centered between the
  upper-back wordmark and the lower hem): The number **"80"** rendered
  identically to the front — white outline + greyscale rose-cluster fill.
  **Technique:** sublimated. **Color:** white outline + greyscale
  rose-cluster fill.

### Sleeves / Collar / Hem / Other

Color spec:
  Solid black (#000000)

Construction:


Render the garment floating on an invisible form (no model, no mannequin) with:
- Deep matte black (#0A0A0A) backdrop with subtle charcoal gradient
- Cool silver key light from upper-left, black fill, thin silver rim light creating metallic edge highlights
- Photorealistic fabric texture with natural 3D drape and shadow

CRITICAL NEGATIVE RULES:
  - This garment has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s)
  - NO logos, NO text, NO patches, NO embroidery — completely blank
  - Do NOT change sizes — if spec says 4.5 inches, render 4.5 inches
  - Do NOT move positions — if spec says left chest, it stays left chest
  - Do NOT invent pockets, stripes, panels, or details not in the reference
  - Do NOT add team names, athlete names, sponsor logos, or league marks
  - FRONT VIEW ONLY — do not show the back
  - Match the reference EXACTLY — this is luxury fashion, accuracy is everything

DO NOT RENDER (authored canonical negatives):
- NO sleeves (this is a basketball tank — sleeveless).
- NO numbers anywhere — front, back, or shoulders.
- NO player name on back.
- NO multi-color rendering of the rose-pattern — greyscale on white only.
- NO red roses, NO kelly-green stems, NO blue clouds in the pattern (the
  rose-cluster is remapped to greyscale silhouettes).
- NO MLB Authentic Collection patch. NO NFL Authentic Collection patch. NO
  Hockey Championship patch — only the NBA patch on this jersey.
- NO solid-color base — the body has the sublimated fading pattern, not a
  plain white field.
- NO embossed/debossed decoration.
- NO tackle-twill anywhere — wordmarks are sublimated, not appliquéd.
- NO standalone embroidered Black Rose rose-cluster on the back-center —
  the rose-cluster appears as part of the sublimated all-over pattern + the
  front medallion only, not as a separate embroidered logo on the back.
- NO buttons, NO placket, NO zipper.
- NO sleeve patches (there are no sleeves to patch).
- NO heat-transfer vinyl other than the sublimated medallion + sublimated
  pattern.

inner lining** against a black hood exterior, long sleeves ending in a
layered striped cuff band, straight hem with a matching layered striped hem
band. Solid **black** base body fabric with **teal/turquoise (cyan)** accent
colorway. Mid-weight knit fabric, hockey-jersey-weight. NOT a basketball

> SR monogram is rendered in **teal/cyan thread** (NOT canonical gold).

  chest): A circular medallion with a teal/cyan + white double-ring border,

  vines, and cloud are all preserved in shape but recolored to the cyan
  palette. **Technique:** sublimated. **Color:** teal/cyan rose-cluster +
  black + white on black ground.

- **front-left-hem / front-belly-lower-left** (~2in × 2.5in, against the
  striped hem band): The Hockey Championship patch (greyscale/silver palette
  patch — see hockey-championship-patch reference). Sewn onto the lower-left
  hip. **Technique:** embroidered-patch.

### Back
- **back-neck** (small, ~2in wide): The SR monogram embroidered directly
  onto the jersey in **teal/cyan thread** (matches the colorway palette).
  **Technique:** embroidered. **Color:** teal/cyan thread on black.

  BEAUTIFUL"** in tackle-twill lettering, baseball-script style, arched across
  the upper back. Rendered in **teal/cyan twill** on the black body.
  **Technique:** tackle-twill. **Color:** teal/cyan twill letters on black
  ground.
- **back-center** (large, ~10in tall, vertically centered): The number
  **"0"** rendered with a **teal/cyan outline edge** and a teal-and-black
  rose-cluster art fill inside the digit form. **Technique:** sublimated.
  **Color:** teal/cyan outline + teal-and-black rose-cluster fill.

### Sleeves / Hood / Hem / Other
- **hood-exterior**: Black to match the body. **Technique:** stitched.
  **Color:** black.
- **hood-interior / hood-lining**: Bright teal/turquoise lining inside the
  hood (visible when the hood is laid back or worn down). **Technique:**

  layered striped band — solid black at the top, then a teal stripe, then
  white, then a series of thin teal stripes / parallel teal lines descending
  toward the cuff edge. **Technique:** sublimated. **Color:** layered black
  + teal/cyan + white.
- **hem / waistband striped band**: The bottom hem of the body has the
  matching striped band — solid black above, teal stripe, white, then thin
  teal stripes wrapping front and back. **Technique:** sublimated. **Color:**
  layered black + teal + white.
- **collar-inside** (~1.75in × 0.75in): Branded woven size tag (universal

These graphics are LOCKED — same size, same position, same colors as the reference. Do not move, resize, or duplicate them.

Color spec:
  Solid black (#000000)

Construction:


Render the garment floating on an invisible form (no model, no mannequin) with:
- Rich black (#0A0A0A) backdrop with barely perceptible crimson warmth in the shadows
- Warm dramatic key light upper-left with subtle crimson gel, dark fill, strong rim light for edge separation
- Photorealistic fabric texture with natural 3D drape and shadow

CRITICAL NEGATIVE RULES:
  - This garment has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s)
  - NO logos, NO text, NO patches, NO embroidery — completely blank
  - Do NOT change sizes — if spec says 4.5 inches, render 4.5 inches
  - Do NOT move positions — if spec says left chest, it stays left chest
  - Do NOT invent pockets, stripes, panels, or details not in the reference
  - Do NOT add team names, athlete names, sponsor logos, or league marks
  - FRONT VIEW ONLY — do not show the back
  - Match the reference EXACTLY — this is luxury fashion, accuracy is everything

DO NOT RENDER (authored canonical negatives):
- NO Love Hurts full lockup (wordmark + broken-heart-and-thorns) on the bag — only the "FANNIE" wordmark + a single small red rose accent appear. The full Love Hurts lockup is for jackets / shorts / shirts, NOT this small accessory.
- NO Black Rose three-rose-cluster on this product — this is a Love Hurts collection product.
- NO multi-color rose-cluster composition — the rose accent is a single small red rose graphic, NOT the full canonical multi-rose-on-cloud composition.
- NO patches on this bag — the wordmark + rose are EMBROIDERED directly into the front face, NOT sewn-on patches.
- NO Authentic Collection patch.
- NO greyscale wordmark — the "FANNIE" lettering is WHITE on the black faux-leather.

- NO additional pockets visible from outside other than the single front zipper-pocket. No back pocket. No side pockets.
- NO hardware in metal-gold or rose-gold finish — all hardware (buckle, zipper) is BLACK.
- NO contrast piping along any edge — the bag is uniformly black faux-leather with no contrast piping or trim.
- NO drawstring closure — closure is the front zipper only.
- NO embossed or debossed branding — the FANNIE wordmark is embroidered, NOT embossed into the faux-leather surface.
- NO real leather (this is **faux-leather / PU pebbled-finish**, not genuine leather).
- NO printed graphics — branding is embroidered.
- NO Skyy Rose Co script logo on this bag — the only branding is "FANNIE" + the small red rose accent.

- NO rose-cluster decoration anywhere on the body — the Bridge Series shorts carry the photographic print only, NO rose graphics layered on top of the body.
- NO Black Rose three-rose-cluster, NO Love Hurts canonical roses, NO SR monogram, NO Authentic Collection patch on these shorts. The Bridge Series is purely the bridge photograph as the brand identifier.

Your job: generate a photorealistic e-commerce product photo showing ONLY the front of this garment.

The garment is . It has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s):
  NONE — this is a plain garment

These graphics are LOCKED — same size, same position, same colors as the reference. Do not move, resize, or duplicate them.

Color spec:
  Solid black (#000000)

Construction:


Render the garment floating on an invisible form (no model, no mannequin) with:
- Warm charcoal (#1A1A1A) fading to deep black, hint of golden hour warmth
- Golden-warm key light upper-left, soft neutral fill, warm rim light creating a premium glow
- Photorealistic fabric texture with natural 3D drape and shadow

CRITICAL NEGATIVE RULES:
  - This garment has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s)
  - NO logos, NO text, NO patches, NO embroidery — completely blank
  - Do NOT change sizes — if spec says 4.5 inches, render 4.5 inches
  - Do NOT move positions — if spec says left chest, it stays left chest
  - Do NOT invent pockets, stripes, panels, or details not in the reference
  - Do NOT add team names, athlete names, sponsor logos, or league marks
  - FRONT VIEW ONLY — do not show the back
  - Match the reference EXACTLY — this is luxury fashion, accuracy is everything

DO NOT RENDER (authored canonical negatives):
- NO pullover construction — this is a ZIP-UP hoodie with a full center-front zipper.
- NO solid mint or solid lavender body — the body is WHITE; the mint-green and lavender stripes are part of the multi-color chevron stripe band only.
- NO white hood — the hood is PINK / light pink (the only solid-pink major color block on the garment).
- NO single-color hood drawstring matching the hood — drawstring is WHITE on the pink hood.
- NO solid-color cuffs or waistband — cuffs and waistband carry the multi-color rainbow stripe band.
- NO contrast piping on the cuffs or waistband — those areas have the stripe band; only the slash pockets have pink piping.
- NO Black Rose three-rose-cluster as a chest emblem — the front-center chest rose is a small pink-tonal canonical rose-cluster (LIGHT PINK), not the canonical greyscale or canonical multi-color version.
- NO Love Hurts canonical roses (red multi-color cluster) — this is a Signature collection product with a pink-tonal rose treatment.
- NO Authentic Collection patch.
- NO Bridge Series photo print on the body.
- NO printed graphics other than the sublimated chevron stripes and small pink rose.
- NO half-zip placket — the zipper runs the FULL body length.
- NO embossed/debossed decoration.
- NO additional pockets on the back or on the sleeves — only the two front slash hand pockets.
- NO chest text or wordmark.
- NO contrast-color sleeve seam.

CANONICAL DESIGN SPEC (authored truth — overrides any conflicting inferred description below):

GARMENT TYPE (must match exactly):
Crew-neck pullover sweatshirt — solid **mint green / seafoam-green** body fabric throughout (front, back, sleeves) with **NO hood, NO zipper, NO color-blocking, NO chevron stripes, NO contrast panels**. Long sleeves, ribbed crew-neck, ribbed cuffs at wrists, ribbed waistband at hem (all in matching mint). Mid-weight cotton-fleece fabric. NOT a hoodie (no hood — this is the no-hood sibling of the Mint & Lavender Hoodie sg-006). NOT a zip-up (pullover construction, no zipper). NOT a chevron-rainbow garment (the sg-006 hoodie has rainbow chevron stripes; this crewneck does NOT — it is a clean solid-mint body with embroidered rose decoration only). NOT a tee (this is a heavier sweatshirt with ribbed cuffs/waistband). The matching mint sweatpants visible in the techflat are sold as a separate companion piece — this dossier covers ONLY the crewneck top.

BRANDING — exactly what to render:
> Logo art canonical references:
> - Canonical rose-cluster art (recolored to lavender / purple per COLORWAY OVERRIDE): `data/brand-logos/red-roses-cloud-cluster.md`
> - Product reference techflat (crewneck top + matching pants visible together):
>   `data/product-references/sg-013-mint-lavender-crewneck-set-techflat.jpeg`
>
> ### COLORWAY OVERRIDE — Lavender / Purple rose-cluster on mint ground
>
> The rose-cluster on the front chest and back-yoke uses the **canonical
> rose-cluster composition** (three roses, stems, thorny vines, cloud at
> base) but RECOLORED to a **LAVENDER / PURPLE** palette:
> - **Petals:** lavender / medium-purple / deep-purple gradient (NOT red,
>   NOT greyscale).
> - **Stems and leaves:** silver-grey or cool grey-purple (NOT kelly green).
> - **Cloud at base:** white-and-light-grey (matching the canonical cloud).
> - **Outlines:** dark purple-grey or black ink outlines.
>
> The catalog name "Mint & Lavender" describes BODY = mint green +
> ROSE-CLUSTER ART = lavender. The body is solid mint; the lavender accent
> is carried entirely by the rose-cluster embroidery on chest and back.

### Back

- **back-body** (entire back field, between the crew-neck collar seam and the waistband): Solid **mint green**, no other decoration. **Technique:** stitched. **Color:** mint green.

Study the reference image carefully. This is a  called "Mint & Lavender Crewneck".

Your job: generate a photorealistic e-commerce product photo showing ONLY the front of this garment.

The garment is . It has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s):
  NONE — this is a plain garment

These graphics are LOCKED — same size, same position, same colors as the reference. Do not move, resize, or duplicate them.

Color spec:
  Solid black (#000000)

Construction:


Render the garment floating on an invisible form (no model, no mannequin) with:
- Warm charcoal (#1A1A1A) fading to deep black, hint of golden hour warmth
- Golden-warm key light upper-left, soft neutral fill, warm rim light creating a premium glow
- Photorealistic fabric texture with natural 3D drape and shadow

CRITICAL NEGATIVE RULES:
  - This garment has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s)
  - NO logos, NO text, NO patches, NO embroidery — completely blank
  - Do NOT change sizes — if spec says 4.5 inches, render 4.5 inches
  - Do NOT move positions — if spec says left chest, it stays left chest
  - Do NOT invent pockets, stripes, panels, or details not in the reference
  - Do NOT add team names, athlete names, sponsor logos, or league marks
  - FRONT VIEW ONLY — do not show the back
  - Match the reference EXACTLY — this is luxury fashion, accuracy is everything

DO NOT RENDER (authored canonical negatives):
- NO hood — this is a CREWNECK, not a hoodie. The Mint & Lavender Hoodie (sg-006) is the hooded sibling; this is the no-hood variant.
- NO zipper — pullover construction, no closure.
- NO chevron rainbow stripes — the sg-006 hoodie has multi-color V-shape rainbow chevron stripes; this crewneck does NOT. The body is solid mint front and back.
- NO multi-color stripe band on cuffs, collar, or waistband — those are SOLID MINT to match the body. The sg-006 hoodie has multi-color stripe cuffs/waistband; this crewneck does NOT.
- NO white body — the body is solid MINT green. (The sg-006 hoodie body is white with mint as a stripe color; this crewneck is the inverse — solid mint body.)
- NO solid lavender body — body is MINT; lavender is the rose-cluster accent only.
- NO red rose-cluster — the rose-cluster is RECOLORED LAVENDER / PURPLE, not the canonical red.
- NO greyscale rose-cluster — the rose-cluster is RECOLORED LAVENDER / PURPLE, not the canonical Black Rose greyscale.
- NO Black Rose three-rose-cluster as a chest emblem (in greyscale) — the chest rose is the lavender-recolored canonical.
- NO Authentic Collection patch (no NFL / NBA / Hockey patch).
- NO Bridge Series photo print on the body.
- NO chest text or wordmark — the only chest decoration is the embroidered rose-cluster.
- NO embossed or debossed decoration.
- NO printed graphics — all decoration is embroidered.
- NO additional pockets — this is a clean pullover crewneck with no pockets.
- NO contrast piping anywhere.
- NO sleeve-stripe tape or contrast sleeve seam.

CANONICAL DESIGN SPEC (authored truth — overrides any conflicting inferred description below):

GARMENT TYPE (must match exactly):
Two-piece matching set sold as a single SKU — **lightweight nylon zip-front hooded windbreaker JACKET + matching nylon track-style PANTS**.

Solid **white** body on both pieces with a **multi-color V-shape rainbow chevron color-block detail** at the upper chest (jacket) and at each upper-thigh (pants), **PINK contrast hood** on the jacket, **multi-color rainbow stripe bands** at the jacket cuffs / hem and the pants waistband / ankle cuffs.

Construction:


Render the garment floating on an invisible form (no model, no mannequin) with:
- Warm charcoal (#1A1A1A) fading to deep black, hint of golden hour warmth
- Golden-warm key light upper-left, soft neutral fill, warm rim light creating a premium glow
- Photorealistic fabric texture with natural 3D drape and shadow

CRITICAL NEGATIVE RULES:
  - This garment has EXACTLY 0 graphic element(s)

  - Do NOT invent pockets, stripes, panels, or details not in the reference
  - Do NOT add team names, athlete names, sponsor logos, or league marks
  - FRONT VIEW ONLY — do not show the back
  - Match the reference EXACTLY — this is luxury fashion, accuracy is everything

DO NOT RENDER (authored canonical negatives):
- NO cotton-fleece — this is **NYLON WINDBREAKER fabric** (lightweight, smooth, water-resistant). The sg-006 hoodie + sg-014 sweatpants set is the cotton-fleece cousin; this set is the NYLON WINDBREAKER variant.
- NO solid black exterior — although the catalog Color field reads "Black", the techflat shows the **WHITE colorway with rainbow chevron and pink hood**. Render the techflat, not the catalog field.
- NO solid hood matching body — the hood is **PINK** contrast against the white body.
- NO single-color drawstring matching the hood — drawstring is WHITE on the pink hood.
- NO solid-color cuffs or waistbands — cuffs and waistbands carry the multi-color rainbow stripe band on BOTH the jacket and the pants.
- NO contrast piping on the cuffs or waistband — those areas have the rainbow stripe band; only the slash pockets carry pink piping.
- NO chevron on the back of the jacket or back of the pants — chevron decorations are on the FRONT only (front-chest jacket, front-thighs pants, sleeve forearm panels).
- NO Black Rose three-rose-cluster as a chest emblem (greyscale) — the front-center-chest-jacket rose is a small pink-tonal canonical rose-cluster.
- NO Love Hurts canonical RED rose-cluster — this Signature set uses the pink-recolored variant.
- NO Authentic Collection patch (no NFL / NBA / Hockey patch).
- NO Bridge Series photo print on either piece.
- NO embossed or debossed decoration.
- NO chest text or wordmark on the jacket front (the only front decoration is the chevron + small pink rose).
- NO printed graphics other than the sublimated chevron stripes and stripe bands.
- NO half-zip placket on the jacket — the zipper runs the FULL body length.
- NO additional pockets on the back of the jacket, pants, or sleeves — only the two front slash hand pockets per piece.
- NO sherpa lining (this is a windbreaker, not a sherpa-lined jacket — sg-009 is the sherpa-lined sibling).
- NO solid back yoke without the SR monogram — the back yoke MUST carry the large SR monogram embroidery (this is the main back-decoration distinguishing the windbreaker set from the sg-006 fleece hoodie which has only a small back-neck SR).
