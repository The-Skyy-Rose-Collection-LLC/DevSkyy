## Executive summary

Fashion storefronts must reduce uncertainty about appearance, fit, value and
service while preserving a differentiated brand world. Current research repeatedly
points toward accurate imagery, sizing/fit support, useful reviews, product detail
and transparent returns as high-priority decision support. Platform and accessibility
requirements are firmer: themes must follow current WordPress/WooCommerce extension
contracts and WCAG-oriented verification. No source proves a universal section order
or conversion uplift; store-specific merchandising decisions remain hypotheses to test.

## 1. What shoppers need to decide

Baymard's 2026 survey describes apparel shopping as a high-uncertainty journey and
reports that fit details are a leading reason shoppers consult reviews
([BAY-2026-QUANT](https://baymard.com/blog/apparel-and-accessories-quantitative-ux-insights-2026)).
Its broader apparel research catalog groups product-page, sizing, navigation and
imagery problems as a dedicated apparel UX domain
([BAY-APPAREL](https://baymard.com/research/apparel-and-accessories)).

Podean's 2025 consumer survey reports product images, size/fit guides, descriptions
and reviews among prominent PDP considerations
([PODEAN-APPAREL-2025](https://podean.com/hubfs/Podeans%20Apparel%20eCommerce%20Report%202025.pdf)).
Rithum's multi-country returns survey independently links fashion returns to fit
and mismatch between products and their descriptions or photos
([RITHUM-RETURNS-2025](https://www.rithum.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rithum-2025-Global-Returns-Profit-Impact-Report.pdf)).

**Inference:** the brain should treat garment truth, fit help, media and service
clarity as core product architecture rather than optional CRO widgets. Placement
and presentation still require brand- and audience-specific testing.

## 2. Fit, reviews and inclusive discovery

Baymard's review research found that users seek fit consensus and can struggle when
it is buried across individual reviews
([BAY-FIT-2024](https://baymard.com/blog/apparel-provide-aggregate-fit-subscore-in-reviews)).
Its 2026 findings also warn that shopper self-identification may not match retail
size-category labels, supporting discovery paths that do not depend on one body label
([BAY-2026-QUANT](https://baymard.com/blog/apparel-and-accessories-quantitative-ux-insights-2026)).
Older apparel testing remains useful as a durable hypothesis library but is marked
for refresh rather than treated as current proof
([BAY-APPAREL-PRACTICES](https://baymard.com/blog/apparel-5-best-practices)).

**Recommendation:** product contracts should support garment/body measurements,
measurement method, model references where authorized, structured fit feedback,
inclusive filters and clear limitations. A fit tool is omitted when the underlying
data or service is absent.

## 3. Returns, trust and service

Rithum reports that return policy influences purchase decisions while overly broad
policies can damage economics, and recommends improving product accuracy and fit
guidance upstream
([RITHUM-RETURNS-2025](https://www.rithum.com/wp-content/uploads/2025/05/Rithum-2025-Global-Returns-Profit-Impact-Report.pdf)).
Podean similarly describes convenience, returns, checkout, product quality and
reviews as relevant purchase drivers
([PODEAN-APPAREL-2025](https://podean.com/hubfs/Podeans%20Apparel%20eCommerce%20Report%202025.pdf)).

**Inference:** returns should be represented both as a transparent customer-service
journey and as privacy-safe product feedback. The correct policy is operational and
regional; a theme must not invent it or hide its costs.

## 4. Luxury and personalization

BCG's 2025 luxury analysis reports dissatisfaction and growing expectations for
continuous service across channels, while framing AI as support for discovery and
client service rather than a substitute for human connection
([BCG-LUXURY-AI-2025](https://www.bcg.com/publications/2025/why-luxury-experience-needs-an-ai-moment)).

This is a single industry source for the luxury-specific claim. It is therefore
`CURRENT` but not sufficient to mandate AI, personalization or clienteling. Such
features require consent, real data, service ownership and an experiment contract.

## 5. WordPress and WooCommerce structure

WooCommerce distinguishes block-template theming from classic PHP overrides and
lists product archive, taxonomy, search, Cart, Checkout and confirmation templates
([WOO-BLOCK-THEMING](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/theming/block-theme-development/theming-woo-blocks/)).
Its Cart/Checkout guidance warns against depending on private nested markup
([WOO-CART-CHECKOUT](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/theming/block-theme-development/cart-and-checkout/))
and its styling guidance prioritizes supported global styles and container-aware
behavior ([WOO-BLOCK-CSS](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/theming/block-theme-development/css-styling/)).
For classic themes, WooCommerce documents hooks and upgrade-sensitive override
structure ([WOO-CLASSIC-TEMPLATES](https://developer.woocommerce.com/docs/theming/theme-development/template-structure/)).

WordPress documents the hierarchy/fallback model
([WP-TEMPLATE-HIERARCHY](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/classic-themes/basics/template-hierarchy/)),
block `/templates` and `/parts`
([WP-BLOCK-TEMPLATES](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/templates/introduction-to-templates/)),
and `theme.json` as the shared settings/styles contract
([WP-THEME-JSON](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/global-settings-and-styles/introduction-to-theme-json/)).
Translation requirements remain part of theme correctness, not optional polish
([WP-I18N](https://developer.wordpress.org/themes/classic-themes/functionality/internationalization/)).

## 6. Accessibility and evidence

WCAG 2.2 is a technology-neutral W3C Recommendation intended to be testable through
both automated and human evaluation
([W3C-WCAG22](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG22/)). A theme brain can encode accessibility
requirements and fixtures, but only candidate-bound testing can support a pass.

## Key takeaways

- Make garment truth, fit, imagery, reviews and service information first-class page contracts.
- Treat merchandising and personalization as evidence-backed hypotheses, not universal wins.
- Maintain complete classic and block mappings and verify current WooCommerce behavior.
- Render HTML for visual review and validate a matching JSON implementation contract.
- Refresh dated research and platform documentation; stale claims become unverified.

## Methodology

Five research sub-questions covered apparel purchase confidence, merchandising and
service, theme structure, accessibility, and structured prompting. Searches used
Exa on 2026-08-06. Sixteen sources across seven hosts were selected, and eight key
sources were fetched for fuller reading. Commercial reports may carry vendor or
commissioning bias; claims were cross-referenced where possible and single-source
luxury conclusions were explicitly limited.
