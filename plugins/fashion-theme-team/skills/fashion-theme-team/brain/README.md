# Fashion Theme Brain

> **SKYYROSE LLC · FASHION THEME BRAIN**  
> *Luxury Grows from Concrete.*

This directory is the active, governed knowledge layer for the Fashion Theme
Team. It converts fashion-commerce evidence, platform requirements, page
anatomy, and prompt patterns into small context packs. It is not a dump that is
loaded wholesale.

## Authority and claim classes

Use sources in this order:

1. Repository instructions, approved brand canon, catalog SOT, and founder decisions.
2. Current official WordPress, WooCommerce, W3C, marketplace, and extension documentation.
3. Dated research recorded in `source-registry.json`.
4. Brain guidance labeled `DURABLE`.
5. `INFERENCE` and `EXPERIMENT` recommendations, which never become facts without evidence.

Every commercial or behavioral statement must carry one of these labels:

- `DURABLE`: stable craft or engineering rule.
- `CURRENT`: dated external evidence with a source ID and review date.
- `BRAND_SPECIFIC`: approved repository or founder fact.
- `INFERENCE`: reasoned recommendation that has not been experimentally verified.
- `EXPERIMENT`: measurable hypothesis with a success metric and guardrail.

Unknowns remain `UNKNOWN`; contradictions remain visible. Never convert a trend,
competitor pattern, or model preference into a universal rule.

## Retrieval protocol

1. Classify the request with `taxonomy.json`.
2. Load this file, `prompts/prompt-stack.md`, and only the matching knowledge and page packs.
3. Load the target repository's instructions, session log, SOT, design system, and implementation evidence.
4. Record every loaded pack in `contract.json.context.loaded_packs`.
5. If a `CURRENT` source is past `review_after`, refresh or downgrade the claim to `UNVERIFIED`.
6. Return `preview.html`, `contract.json`, and `evidence.json` using the schemas in `schemas/`.

## Non-negotiables

- The garment and its truthful information remain the protagonist.
- Never invent products, prices, inventory, materials, sustainability claims, reviews, urgency, or permissions.
- Never use visual polish to conceal missing commerce states or broken customer journeys.
- HTML is the visual contract; JSON is the machine contract. Both describe the same stable IDs.
- A builder cannot approve its own output. Visual claims require rendered eyes-on review.
- A conversion hypothesis without measurement is an opinion, not a pass condition.
