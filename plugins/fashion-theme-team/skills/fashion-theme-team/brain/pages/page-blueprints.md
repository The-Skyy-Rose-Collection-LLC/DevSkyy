# Complete Fashion Commerce Page Blueprints

> **SKYYROSE LLC · FASHION THEME BRAIN**  
> *Luxury Grows from Concrete.*

V2 visual layouts and imagery direction: [`../v2/v2-page-and-imagery-plan.md`](../v2/v2-page-and-imagery-plan.md).

These are starting contracts, not fixed wireframes. Section order follows customer
intent, brand strategy, real data and approved commerce configuration. Any omission
or reordering must be explicit in `contract.json`.

Every route covers loading, empty, error, success, unavailable, long-content,
missing-optional-media, keyboard, reduced-motion, mobile, tablet and desktop states.
Every section declares purpose, data source, component IDs, responsive behavior,
analytics, accessibility and evidence.
