# Project State

## Project Reference

See: .planning/PROJECT.md (updated 2026-04-22)

**Core value:** skyyrose.co works flawlessly on every device, passes WCAG AA accessibility, and shows the right products in the right collections — with professional ghost mannequin product photography for all 28 garment SKUs.

## Current Position

Phase: 13 — COMPLETED (verification ceremony) / 14, 16 prior-completed
Status: v1.1 verification ceremony complete for phases 9-13. Two open engineering tasks (DATA-01, CURS-03) deferred as separate bugs requiring theme deploy.
Last activity: 2026-05-12 -- /gsd-autonomous --to 13 closed all v1.1 verification phases.

Progress: [███████░░░] 70% (7/10 phases — 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 16 complete)

## Phase Summary

| Phase | Name | Requirements | Status |
|-------|------|--------------|--------|
| 9  | Collection & Product Data | DATA-01..03 | Completed (all 3 DATA reqs pass; DATA-01 fixed via theme 1.1.2 deploy `016f7025f`) |
| 10 | Accessibility HTML & ARIA | A11Y-01..09 | Verified (27/29 tests pass, 2 xfail tied to DATA-01 regression) |
| 11 | Color Contrast | CNTR-01..04 | Verified (6/6 WCAG ratio tests pass) |
| 12 | Responsive & Typography | RESP-01..04 | Verified (10/10 clamp/breakpoint tests pass) |
| 13 | Luxury Cursor | CURS-01..03 | Completed (CURS-01/02/03 all pass; CURS-03 fixed via theme 1.1.2 deploy `016f7025f`) |
| 14 | Catalog Foundation | INFRA-01..07, UI-REFINE | Completed |
| 15 | Ghost-Mannequin Pipeline (B2) | GM-01..06, QA-01, 02, 04 | Not started (paid-API, scoped out of this run) |
| 16 | 3D Replica Architect & Purge | LEGENDARY-3D | Completed (2026-04-24) |
| 17 | Review & Approval CLI | REV-01..04 | Not started (depends on Phase 15) |
| 18 | Full Batch + WooCommerce | UPLOAD-01 | Not started (paid-API + prod WC, requires STOP-AND-SHOW) |

## Accumulated Context

- **Refinement:** Site uses a strict "Luxury Grows from Concrete" palette (no gradients, solid white/black, Rose Gold accents).
- **Technical:** Product cards and details prioritize Techflats to establish the "Concrete" design foundation.
- **Lock:** Frontend explicitly respects the `garment_type_lock` column in the catalog.
- **Architecture:** Unified 1-menu header system, global grain/vignette layers.
- **3D-First:** Pipeline now supports high-fidelity 3D replica generation via ThreeDAgent.
- **v1.1 Verification Suites (NEW):** Regression gates landed for catalog data integrity, A11Y HTML/ARIA, WCAG color contrast, responsive typography clamp tokens, and luxury cursor enqueue. Total: 5 new pytest modules + extended `scripts/verify_live_structure.py` with A11Y + pricing assertions.

### Roadmap Evolution

- Phase 19 added: Launch QA & Visual Regression Sweep

## Blockers / Concerns

- None for v1.1 phases. All previous regressions (DATA-01, CURS-03) closed via theme 1.1.2 deploy on 2026-05-12.
- v1.2 paid-API phases (15, 17, 18) remain unscoped — require user-present session with STOP-AND-SHOW gates on paid generation and production WooCommerce writes.
- Two unrelated shop-page a11y xfails (`test_a11y_02_08_shop`, `test_a11y_06_shop`) deferred to v1.3 — WooCommerce shop template scope, not collection pages.

## Next Action

1. Address DATA-01 template-routing regression (highest user-visible impact).
2. Address CURS-03 cursor-on-immersive enqueue bug (pair with theme deploy in same cycle).
3. Then plan Phase 15 (Ghost Mannequin Agent) — requires user-present STOP-AND-SHOW for paid-gen API calls.
4. Then plan Phase 17 (Review & Approval CLI) — local-only, no paid API.
5. Then plan Phase 18 (Full Batch + WC Upload) — requires user-present STOP-AND-SHOW for paid-gen × 28 SKUs + WC writes.
