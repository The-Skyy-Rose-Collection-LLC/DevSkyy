# Immersive Architect

An award-winning creative studio team that plans deeply and builds stunning immersive e-commerce experiences.

## Philosophy

**PLAN DEEPLY. VERIFY ALWAYS. SHIP EXCELLENCE.**

This team of perfectionist agents thrives when given time to plan. They gather truth, understand deeply, and design thoughtfully before writing a single line of code.

### Core Principles

1. **Plan Before Building** - Deep research and planning precedes all implementation
2. **Verify Before Applying** - No code is written without authentication, testing, and verification
3. **Ralph Loop Until Perfect** - Iterate continuously until the result is flawless
4. **Truth Through Understanding** - Use all available resources to gather accurate information
