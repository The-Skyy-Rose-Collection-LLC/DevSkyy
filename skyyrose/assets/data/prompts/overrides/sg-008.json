    "notes": "The branding element is a pre-made patch that is likely sewn onto the beanie. The design on the patch features distinct 3D raised elements with a smooth, slightly glossy, rubbery texture, which aligns with the characteristics of a molded silicone (or PVC) application. Given the provided options, 'silicone' is the most accurate description for this type of molded, raised graphic on a patch.",
