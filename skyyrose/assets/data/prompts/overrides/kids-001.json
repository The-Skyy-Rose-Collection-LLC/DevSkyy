    "notes": "The resolution for the circular emblem on the left sleeve made precise identification challenging. While it appears flat with a crisp edge, indicative of a heat-transfer application, a very fine screen print could also achieve a similar look. However, the distinct applied layer quality points more strongly to heat-transfer. The two embroidered elements are clearly identifiable by their raised thread texture.",
