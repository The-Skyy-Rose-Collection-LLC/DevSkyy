    "notes": "The hoodie is a dark green/grey color. All identified elements exhibit distinct characteristics aligning with the specified decoration techniques. The hood lining pattern appears to be integrated into the fabric fibers, consistent with sublimation, rather than a surface print. The chest item is clearly a separate, embroidered badge sewn on, while the sleeve item is embroidery directly onto the garment fabric.",
