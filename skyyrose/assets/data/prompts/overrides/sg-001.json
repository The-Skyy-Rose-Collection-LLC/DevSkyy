    "notes": "The primary challenge was discerning between 'printed' and 'heat-transfer' for the textured rose graphics. Given the explicit definition of 'printed' as 'flat' and 'heat-transfer' allowing for 'different texture than fabric' and 'slight edge visible', the prominent raised texture on the rose graphics strongly points towards a sophisticated heat-transfer application rather than a flat print. The sublimated all-over print on the shorts is clearly distinct due to its dye-into-fabric nature with no surface texture.",
