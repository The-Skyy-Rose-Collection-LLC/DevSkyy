"""
Creative Operations Hub LangGraph router.

Builds the unified StateGraph for all 14 creative intents.

The graph supports optional PostgreSQL checkpointing via
`get_creative_graph_async()`. When a Postgres `DATABASE_URL` is
configured, the graph persists state after every node — letting a
failed run (e.g., a Tripo3D 5xx) resume from the last successful node
instead of silently losing the whole pipeline. Without `DATABASE_URL`,
the graph runs without checkpointing (the original behaviour).
