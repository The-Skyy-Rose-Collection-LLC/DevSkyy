"""Stage 1 prompts — clean garment, NO decoration.

The Stage 1 FLUX Kontext call must produce a clean garment shape with the
correct silhouette, fabric, and colorway — but NO decoration anywhere.
Decoration is applied separately in Stage 3 via masked inpainting.

This is the structural separation that prevents decoration drift: Stage 1
can't render decoration on a cuff if no decoration is described.
