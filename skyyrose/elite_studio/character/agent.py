"""
Character creation agent for SkyyRose Elite Studio.

Builds reference sheet prompts for brand characters, with special support
for the canonical SkyyRose mascot 'Rosie'.

Rosie already exists — reference assets live at:
  - assets/branding/mascot/skyyrose-mascot-reference.png  (primary)
  - skyyrose/assets/images/source-products/brand-assets/skyyrose-avatar-reference.jpeg

The frontend mascot system (/api/mascot, MascotBubble.tsx) is the canonical
generation system. This agent bridges Rosie into the Elite Studio creative pipeline.
