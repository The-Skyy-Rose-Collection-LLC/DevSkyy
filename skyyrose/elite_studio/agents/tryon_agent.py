TryOnAgent — Phase 16 Legendary Try-On Architect.

Promoted to ADK SuperAgent for comprehensive "Back Data" (telemetry) and
high-fidelity virtual try-on.

Inherits from BaseSuperAgent to leverage standardized enterprise tools
and observability via Google ADK.

REAL FASHN integration as of D7 (2026-05-22) — the prior pass-through stub at
line 53 has been removed. Callers must pass public HTTPS image URLs; local
file paths raise FashnError. Upload local renders to Cloudflare R2 (or any
public host) before passing them here.
