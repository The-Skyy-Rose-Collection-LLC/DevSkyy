# Important Note:
# This project is a Python FastAPI backend, not a static site.
# Cloudflare Pages is designed for static sites.
#
# Options:
# 1. Use this configuration to deploy documentation/static files only
# 2. Deploy the FastAPI backend to Cloudflare Workers (limited Python support)
# 3. Continue using Vercel for full backend functionality (recommended)
