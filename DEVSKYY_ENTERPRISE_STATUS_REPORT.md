## ⚠️ **REMAINING TECHNICAL DEBT**

### **High Priority Issues**
1. **Agent Module Syntax Errors** (104 files)
   - Many agent modules have indentation and syntax issues
   - Requires systematic file-by-file review and fixing
   - Impact: Limits agent functionality availability

2. **API Router Completeness**
   - Some API routers have syntax errors preventing loading
   - Missing enterprise security router implementations
   - Impact: Reduced API endpoint availability

3. **Test Suite Validation**
   - Many test files have syntax errors
   - Test coverage needs validation
   - Impact: Reduced confidence in deployments

### **Medium Priority Issues**
1. **Database Integration**
   - Some database modules have syntax issues
   - Connection pooling needs validation
   - Impact: Potential database connectivity issues

2. **ML Pipeline Completeness**
   - Some ML engines have syntax errors
   - Model loading and inference needs testing
   - Impact: Reduced AI capabilities
