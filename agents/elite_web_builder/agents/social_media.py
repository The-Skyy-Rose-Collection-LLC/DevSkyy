"""Social Media Agent — High-level social content for the SkyyRose brand.

Produces launch-ready content across Instagram, TikTok, X/Twitter, and
Facebook. Pairs with the Imagery Agent (who supplies visuals) and the SEO
Content Agent (who supplies long-form copy). Owns platform-specific voice,
hashtag strategy, and campaign orchestration.

Model: Claude Sonnet 4.6 (best for brand-voice copy + structured output)
Outputs land as JSON in output/social/ and are picked up by the existing
``frontend/app/api/social-media/generate/route.ts`` endpoint OR scheduled
directly via Klaviyo / Meta Business Suite.
