"""Imagery Agent — Highest-level image generation for the SkyyRose brand.

Bridges the Elite Web Builder team to the existing 10-agent Elite Studio
image pipeline (`skyyrose/elite_studio/agents/`). The pipeline covers:

    1. vision_agent            — read reference assets + extract product DNA
    2. prompt_enrichment_agent — turn DNA + brand spec into a generation prompt
    3. generator_agent         — multi-engine generation (GPT-Image / Gemini Pro / FLUX)
    4. compositor_agent        — 6-stage composite (BRIA → Opus → IC-Light → FLUX Fill → GPS shadows → Gemini QA)
    5. quality_agent           — dual-LLM QA (Claude + Gemini) with 0..100 scoring
    6. variant_agent           — A/B variants for copy/marketing reuse
    7. color_correction_agent  — final color grade against brand tokens
    8. upscaling_agent         — 4x upscale for hero/lookbook deliverables
    9. safety_agent            — brand-safety + likeness + IP checks
   10. tryon_agent             — virtual try-on for lifestyle compositing

Model: Claude Opus 4.6 (the brain that prompts FLUX/Gemini as "hands")
Budget: every batch is protected by the ``--max-cost`` ceiling wired into
        ``scripts/nano-banana-run.py`` — halts the pipeline before crossing
        a declared USD cap to prevent runaway fallback spend.
