"""
SDK Brand Guardian Domain Agent
==================================

SDK-powered agent that enforces brand consistency across all
touchpoints — copy, visuals, code, and external communications.

Acts as the brand's immune system: detects deviations, flags
violations, and auto-corrects common drift patterns.

Agent:
    SDKBrandGuardianAgent — Brand consistency, tone, compliance
