"""
SDK Immersive 3D/AR Experience Agents
=======================================

The crown jewel of the SkyyRose dashboard — SDK-powered agents that
build immersive 3D shopping experiences end-to-end.

Pipeline:
    1. SDKGarment3DAgent    → Generate 3D clothing models (Tripo API)
    2. SDKSceneBuilderAgent → Build Three.js immersive shopping worlds
    3. SDKAvatarStylistAgent → Dress the SkyyRose Pixar avatar in outfits

These agents compose the full experience:
    Garment → 3D model (GLB) → Scene placement → Avatar try-on

Agents:
    SDKGarment3DAgent       — Text/image → 3D garment (Tripo3D API)
    SDKSceneBuilderAgent    — Build Three.js immersive shopping environments
    SDKAvatarStylistAgent   — Dress SkyyRose avatar, swap outfits, animate
