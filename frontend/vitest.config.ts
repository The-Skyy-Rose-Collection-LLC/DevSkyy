// imported under vitest: `lib/wp/client.ts` sits behind a `server-only`
// boundary the resolver cannot satisfy, and anything reaching into next-auth
// or next/server drags the framework in. Both included patterns are
// framework-free by construction:
//   - lib/wp/**       — the WP-wiring modules (auth-policy, signature, throttle)
//   - tests/**        — node-only suites; api-auth-coverage reads route files
//                       from disk and imports only lib/api-public-routes,
//                       which has no imports at all.
// Keep that property when adding a suite here. A test that cannot import its
// subject gets skipped, and a skipped security test reads exactly like a
// passing one.
