/**
 * Route-handler authentication gate for the DevSkyy dashboard API.
 *
 * Replaces the removed `proxy.ts` matcher-based gate. That gate was fail-closed
 * by construction — a new route under /api was gated the moment it existed,
 * because the matcher was an exclusion list. Per-handler auth inverts that: a
 * new route is OPEN until someone remembers to wrap it.
 *
 * Two things restore the fail-closed property:
 *   1. `withAuth()` — wrapping is structural, not a convention. An unwrapped
 *      export is visible in the source as a bare function.
 *   2. `tests/api-auth-coverage.test.ts` — enumerates every app/api route file
 *      and fails when a handler is neither wrapped nor on PUBLIC_API_ROUTES.
 *      Adding an ungated route breaks the build rather than shipping a hole.
 *
 * NextAuth v4 (4.24.x): the session is read with `getServerSession(authOptions)`.
 * The v5 `auth()` wrapper does not exist in this major — do not port it here
 * without also migrating lib/auth.ts.
