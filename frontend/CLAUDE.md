# Frontend — devskyy-dashboard (Next.js 16 · React 19)

Scoped context for `frontend/`. Loads on top of the root CLAUDE.md. Commands + "npm not pnpm" are in root.
The gotchas below are the ones a fresh session gets wrong.

## Auth — two systems, do not conflate

- **Admin (`/admin/*`): NextAuth v4.** `lib/auth.ts` + `SessionProvider` (`app/admin/layout.tsx`). Server-side: `getServerSession(authOptions)`. Client-side: `useSession()`. JWT, 15-min expiry.
- **Storefront/legacy:** `contexts/AuthContext.tsx` → `useAuth()`, `localStorage` key `access_token`. NOT used by any admin page. `lib/api/client.ts` also reads this key directly for backend calls. Calling `useAuth()` in an admin page gets undefined context.
- **Edge gate = `proxy.ts`, NOT `middleware.ts`.** Next.js 16 **deprecated `middleware.ts` in favor of `proxy.ts`** (both still resolve — a lone `middleware.ts` only warns, both-present is a hard error; named export `middleware` → `proxy`). `frontend/proxy.ts` exports `async function proxy()` + `export const config.matcher` — this IS the registered gate and it DOES run. Add gated paths via `config.matcher` (`proxy.ts:42`). Caveat: `proxy` runs the **nodejs** runtime — edge is not supported in `proxy`; keep a `middleware.ts` only if you need edge. Per-route `getServerSession()` stays as defense-in-depth.

## Catalog data is SERVER-ONLY

`lib/catalog.ts` and `lib/catalog-server.ts` use `node:fs` (`catalog.ts:13`). Importing either from a `'use client'` component **crashes the build**. Client code must call the REST routes (`/api/catalog`, `/api/catalog/[sku]`). The CSV resolver walks up 6 dirs from `process.cwd()` (`catalog.ts:48`) — confirm Vercel `rootDirectory=frontend` keeps `wordpress-theme/skyyrose-flagship/data/skyyrose-catalog.csv` in scope.

## State management — three layers, pick the right one

- Server/API data → **TanStack Query** (`@tanstack/react-query`, `useQuery`).
- Persistent cart → **Zustand** + `persist` (`lib/stores/cart-store.ts`).
- Admin auth → **NextAuth** `useSession()`.
- `jotai` is in package.json but unused in admin — don't introduce atoms without confirming the domain isn't already one of the above.

## API barrel — never bypass it

Always import from `@/lib/api` (re-exports via `lib/api.ts` → `lib/api/index.ts`). To add an endpoint: (1) file in `lib/api/endpoints/`, (2) Zod schema in `lib/api/schemas.ts`, (3) register in `lib/api/index.ts`. Direct imports from `@/lib/api/endpoints/*` bypass the unified `api` object the pages depend on.

## UI components

shadcn/ui **"new-york"** style, `rsc: true` (`components.json`). Install primitives with `npx shadcn@latest add <name>` (don't copy default-style examples). Icons: **`lucide-react` only**. Primitives land in `components/ui/`.

## E2E tests — canonical dir is `tests/e2e/`

`playwright.config.ts:4` sets `testDir: './tests/e2e'`. The legacy `frontend/e2e/` dir is NOT executed — new specs go to `tests/e2e/`. No Jest/unit runner is wired (`npm test` has no script) despite `@testing-library/react` being installed. Launch/smoke the app with the `run-devskyy-dashboard` skill.

## next.config.ts — leave the Vercel guard alone

`outputFileTracingRoot` and `turbopack.root` are set ONLY when `!process.env.VERCEL` (`next.config.ts:13`). Setting them unconditionally causes a doubled-path crash on Vercel builds. Do not touch this conditional.
